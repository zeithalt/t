## [Eon 843](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0843>) - The Fall of Admincity

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

The alliance between Minds and [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) stands strong for another battle.

This time these factions strike a deal - [MT receives Virtuara Outpost](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0842>) just in time to launch a surprise attack on [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) capital - [Admincity](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/admincity.html>).

In return, the Minds provide the Deltans support, in both, troops and resources to take over the capital.

When the fighting breaks out, it catches Cybers completely off guard. The city is not prepared for a full-scale assault, and the defenders are quickly overwhelmed.

In the effort to save the situation, Cybers coordinate with [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) to launch a costly special operation, but it is met with even greater resistance from the Deltans.

In the end, the city falls, and the Deltans take control of the capital.

Notably, the Deltan army decides not to plunder the city, leaving it mostly intact and vulnerable to a potential counter-attacks.

The fall of Admincity is a significant blow to the Cybers, and it is yet to be seen how they will respond to this loss.
