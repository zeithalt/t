## [Eon 1251](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1251>) - Another Dark Night on the Mire

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) (combines faction forces)

A dark night fell onto the Mire, as the hundreds of eons old saying _"Corruption never attacks Protectores Silva"_ is finally proven wrong.

The [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) does attack [Oblivion Mire](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/oblivion_mire.html>) and the [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) is forced to have the first-hand experience of dealing with the [corruption outburst](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_fallout.html>).

The event results in devastation and chaos throughout the region, outbursts popping up everywhere, leaving no land safe from it.

During a long and exhausting battle, the factions once again are able to unite against the common threat despite the mutual hatred and rivalry.

At a great cost, yet another outburst is contained, but it only means one thing - the next one, even more powerful, is just around the corner.
