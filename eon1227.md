## [Eon 1227](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1227>) - Lucrative Battle of Xyrclaox Watch

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

The newly formed [Cybernetic Imperium](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1221>) delivers on its intention and attacks [Xyrclaox Watch](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/xyrclaox_watch.html>) in a battle known as _Lucrative Battle of Xyrclaox Watch_.

[MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>), not being involved in any battles for 384 eons was thought to be an easy target. However, an unexpected force has entered the battlefield and altered the balance of power.

[Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) has been "woken up" by the heavy battle activity, and it resulted in the first ever human-made [outburst](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_fallout.html>) in the history of _Zeithalt_.

This brought a lot of confusion and disorganization to the early part of the battle, hindering the attacking efforts to a great extent.

It is not fully known why the Emperor NAIRO chose a neutral faction as his target, however prolonged stay of [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) in former CI capital and their presence in battle are believed to be involved in the decision.

The battle ended with a decisive victory for the _Minds_, but it came at literally a great cost. The paycheck from the [Fighters Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>) it believed to be on par or even greater than the entire budgets of some factions.
