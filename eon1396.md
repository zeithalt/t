## [Eon 1396](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1396>) - Failed Cleanup of Ares Garden

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>)

After the recent [failed attempt to clean up Webified Hills](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1389>), the mood on the island was pessimistic.

A combined factions' force gathered a relatively modest cleanup crew at the border between [Ares Garden](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/ares_gardens.html>) and the [Deltan capital](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/purple_deeps.html>) to try and push the [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) back from the city.

Initial efforts seemed successful, but as night fell, the heavy losses began.

Despite the strong start, the cleanup operation triggered a _Corruption Outburst_ that dealt a devastating blow to the factions' forces, forcing them into a full retreat.

However, the event was not a total loss. In that outburst, the _Corruption_ seems to have expended a significant amount of its energy. It is now predicted that the remaining corruption on the Island has lost about half its strength, which should make future cleanup attempts easier.

This potential advantage came at a great cost. Several notable warriors fell ill with [acute corruption sickness](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_sickness.html>), and more importantly, the protective buffer between the corrupted Ares region and Purple Deeps was breached. The Deltan capital now lies directly in range of the next major CR Outburst.
