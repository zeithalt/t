## [Eon 582](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0582>) - The Advance on Peace Death Gorge

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

In an unexpected strategic move, [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) were able to make [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) expect an attack on [Dev Null Marsh](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/dev_null_marsh.html>) and divert all their defences there, while the actual advance happened in [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>).

Due to careful planning and good execution, joint forces of [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) and [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) were able to dominate the battlefield and win this battle.
