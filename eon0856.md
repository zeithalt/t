## [Eon 856](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0856>) - The Foolish Battle of Chaotic Plains

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

In retaliation to previous joint [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) and [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) attacks, [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) launched a surprise attack on the [Chaotic Plains](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/chaotic_plains.html>).

However, this battle was destined to fail from the start. 

The [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) stays the major power on the Island, on top of that they had the contract with the [Fighters Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>) to provide additional support. Minds forces also joined the defence with the [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>) on their side.

From the attacking side it was only Silvans, Cybers, and a few independent Sellsword groups.

The battle was an honorable strike back from [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) to show their determination, but it was still a defeat.

There was nothing foolish in their actions, the battle simply got this name because it happened shortly before the Fool's Day.
