## [Eon 573](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0573>) - The Battle of Corrupted Valley

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) (combined faction forces)

Factions are able to put aside their differences and arguments to fend off [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) in the [Singularity Valley](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/singularity_valley.html>).

[Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) in coordination with other factions did a very good job preparing for the battle - [Corrupted Mines](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_mines.html>) were installed, defenses strengthened, fortifications built… it all paid off in the end.

As expected after two violent _Corruption_ outbursts, it seems to have released some of its pressure and this battle proved to be easier.

On the other hand, it means the next battle will be harder.
