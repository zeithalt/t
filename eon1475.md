## [Eon 1475](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1475>) - Clean-up of Peace Death Gorge

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

The winning streak of anti-[Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) efforts continues in [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>). Following a very close victory, the region - which had remained Corruption-ridden throughout the entirety of the State of Emergency - has finally been cleared.

The tried-and-tested strategy was perfectly executed once more, cleaning up the region in full.

Notably, some factions were seen withholding resources and fortifying their own defenses along the Deltan border, instead of assisting with the anti-Corruption efforts.

Even though a new [CR Outburst](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_fallout.html>) is already on the horizon, the factions are, for once, hopeful and confident in their ability to meet it with full force and prevent a new State of Emergency.

However, the tensions are slowly rising as the _Corruption_ threat is brought under control, new and interesting times might await Zeithalt Island in the future.
