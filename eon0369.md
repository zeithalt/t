Brave sellsword warriors [Mimb](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mimb.html), [Ozimud](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/ozimud.html) and _Gabrio_, joined by CI member *Gabriel Santiago* and led by a prominent MT official [Ogrodnik](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/ogrodnik.html) formed a new faction.

They reached a peaceful agreement of lands gift from [MindTech Institute](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html), and established their capital in [Cerene Vale](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cerene_vale.html) - their newly found homeland.

The founding statement from this new faction to the people of Zeithalt is:

> *Zeithalt is changing, under threat from unnatural disturbances and behavior. We must protect her and live in balance with nature to thrive long-term.*
