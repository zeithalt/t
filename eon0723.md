## [Eon 723](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0723>) - 2nd Sabotage in the Desert

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

After failing to secure a contract with [Fighters Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>), [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) return to their previous tactic of sabotaging the [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>).

This tactic proves useful again, as the Cybers are able to trigger [CR Mines](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_mines.html>) and interrupt [Temporal Resource](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/temporal_resources.html>) production in the region.

However, the battle itself was heavily dominated by [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) forces helping MT defend, while Cybers and Silvans mostly conserved their forces for the upcoming MT retribution.
