## [Eon 946](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0946>) - Expensive Battle of Ares Gardens

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

In a daring move, [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) has managed to take control of [Ares Gardens](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/ares_gardens.html>) from [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>).

The battle was unprecedentedly expensive from Cybers' point of view, and quite lucrative - from the Fighters Guild's perspective. 

Some reports show that [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) treasury lost upwards of 7000 gold coins on the services of just four men.

Another curious moment was the declared neutrality of [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) being extended to not supporting [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) defensive efforts in this battle - leaving a very bitter taste in the mouths of the former allies.

In the end, the attackers outnumbered the defenders 2 to 1 and were hugely successful in this battle.
