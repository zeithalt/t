## [Eon 1334](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1334>) - Calculated Defense of Cybertron Jungle

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) (combined faction forces)

After a cycle of devastating battles, an old force once again loomed over the Island.

The [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) outburst began swiftly spreading across the [Cybertron Jungle](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybertron_jungle.html>), engulfing the entire region.

However, the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) already had detailed battle plans in place.

They identified several key locations that were crucial for the defense of the region, and the majority of the battle was devoted to holding these lands until the final push back.

At several points, these key locations were under threat of falling to _Corruption_; however, overall, the plan was executed flawlessly, and the defenders were able to hold the line.

The battle ended with a decisive victory for the _Brothers_, who were able to push back the Corruption and secure the majority of the region.
