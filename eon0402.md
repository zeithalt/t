## [Eon 402](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0402>) - The Night Battle of Paradox Pass

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

[Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>) were able to defend their lands in this battle, with the help of [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) (and some [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) involvement in the end of the battle).

Worth noting that both MT garrisons were located in the area, greatly helping with defences - as if Minds wildly gambled or been informed of the attack.

This battle happened at night time for most of the participants and took longer than usual to finish, granting its name - The Night Battle of [Paradox Pass](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/paradox_pass.html>).
