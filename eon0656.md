## Eon 656 - The Sabotage in the Desert

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html)

[Cybernetics Inc](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html) launches an attack on [Timeless Desert](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html)’s infrastructure in a battle known as _Sabotage in the Desert_.

As declared by the [Cybers](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html), the goal of this attack wasn't to conquer the _Desert_, but rather to interrupt its production and weaken its defences.

The initial blow alone achieved both of these objectives. [Corrupted Mines](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_mines.html) were triggered in the area, and the first attacks indeed disrupted [Temporal Resource](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/temporal_resources.html) production for several eons.

Afterward, the pace of the attacking activity slowed significantly, and the _MindTech Institute_ in a coalition with [Deltan](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html) forces was able to secure victory in the battle, while [Protectores Silva](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html) remained mostly neutral.

It's difficult to determine a clear "winner" in this battle, as both sides claim to have achieved their goals on the battlefield. What remains certain is that, even after seven battles, the _Desert_ still stands unconquered.
