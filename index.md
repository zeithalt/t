## <a id="eon1354"></a>Eon 1354 - An Oopsie in Ares Garden

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>)

Just as the Deltans seemed to be ready to launch their offensive, a calamity struck in [Ares Garden](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/ares_gardens.html>).

An odd silence had fallen along the Deltan borders, and their rivals, especially the [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>), braced for an attack... that never came.

Soon, reports clarified the situation - an unpredicted [CR Outburst](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_fallout.html>) had occurred in _Ares Garden_.

The Deltan forces, caught completely off guard, scrambled to organize a defense, frantically calling for aid from other factions.

This chaotic organization took significant time, allowing the _Corruption_ to take a firm hold and spread rapidly through the land.

A final, desperate pushback from the allied factions managed to secure the border between _Ares_ and the Deltan capital, but it was nowhere near enough to contain the _Corruption_.

For the first time in 370 eons, the _Zeithalt Island_ was thrown into a [state of emergency](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/boz_state_of_emergency.html>). Several notable warriors fell victim to [CR sickness](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_sickness.html>) and massive casualties and displacement were recorded among the civilian population of _Ares Garden_.

## <a id="eon1343"></a>Eon 1343 - Sneezing Battle of Synaxos Fields

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

The [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) began its carefully planned recapture of [Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>) at night; however, it quickly became apparent that the [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) did not plan to defend this land, [much like in a previous encounter](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1327>).

Quickly losing ground, their forces mounted a minimal defense, only to ensure safe passage for their retreating troops.

However, the battle's unexpected complication was a [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) outburst spilling over from the nearby lands of [Xyrclaox Watch](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/xyrclaox_watch.html>).

Although the _Minds_ seemed prepared for this, the _Corruption_ broke through their defense line and began to spread rapidly across the _Synaxos Fields_.

While there were reports of the [Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) aiding the _Corruption_ early on - with some speculating they were responsible for the breach - Deltans from both factions were also seen helping the Minds fight against it.

One of the most notable events of the battle was an outbreak of a mutated [Mimps Virus](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mimps.html>) variant that caused excessive sneezing across the battlefield.

Warriors compromised their positions, missed their targets, and overall fought inefficiently due to frequent and violent sneezing fits.

## <a id="eon1341"></a>Eon 1341 - CI transfers control over Paradox Pass to MT

`⌛ Event`

[Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) transfers its portion of the [Paradox Pass](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/paradox_pass.html>) region to the [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>).

This move solidifies the recent shift within Cybernetics Inc following the fall of the [Cybernetic Imperium](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1221>) and seems to indicate that the two factions are on a course towards reconciliation.

The majority of _Paradox Pass_ is now back under the control of the _MindTech Institute_.

While it's worth noting that a third of the land is still occupied by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) forces, they are now almost fully encircled by the _MindTech_ army in this region.

## <a id="eon1334"></a>Eon 1334 - Calculated Defense of Cybertron Jungle

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) (combined faction forces)

After a cycle of devastating battles, an old force once again loomed over the Island.

The [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) outburst began swiftly spreading across the [Cybertron Jungle](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybertron_jungle.html>), engulfing the entire region.

However, the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) already had detailed battle plans in place.

They identified several key locations that were crucial for the defense of the region, and the majority of the battle was devoted to holding these lands until the final push back.

At several points, these key locations were under threat of falling to _Corruption_; however, overall, the plan was executed flawlessly, and the defenders were able to hold the line.

The battle ended with a decisive victory for the _Brothers_, who were able to push back the Corruption and secure the majority of the region.

## <a id="eon1327"></a>Eon 1327 - Effortless Recapture of Neuropolis

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

Although the _MindTech Institute_ was well-prepared for this battle, it soon became clear that the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) had no intention of fighting for [Neuropolis](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/neuropolis.html>).

At the first sign of an attack, the _Brothers'_ forces quickly retreated, leaving the city to the defenders.

Occasional skirmishes were reported, but these were mostly cover for the _Brothers_ to ensure a safe retreat for their forces.

In a notable event, the [Fighters Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>) used their outpost, acquired during the [siege of Neuropolis](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1313>), to get a head start on the defenders. They even held almost a third of the city for a time, but eventually ceded it to the _Minds_ as well.

In the end, despite having fallen just a dozen eons prior, the city was recaptured by the _Minds_ with little effort and next to no casualties.

## <a id="eon1320"></a>Eon 1320 - The Fall of Timeless Desert

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

[Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>), which had stood strong for 1,068 eons of Zeithalt’s recorded history, has finally fallen.

The unexpected assault by Deltan forces marked a turning point - this was the first time the [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>) had been attacked since their founding.

Caught between the _Delta Collective_ to the south and the [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) to the north, the defenders suffered heavy losses and were forced to retreat early.

In a last-ditch effort, they poured every resource into a counteroffensive - emptying the faction’s treasury and deploying all available forces - but it was not enough to stop the Deltan advance.

The Fall of the Desert marked the end of an era, as the Deltans sealed the fate of the island’s old way of life.

The immediate aftermath was devastating: the _Cloudy Operatives_ were all but annihilated, their faction put on the brink of extinction.

The Valkyrie Spec Ops - once the core of the [Fighters Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>) based in [The Nest](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/the_nest.html>) - lost their headquarters and were disbanded.

Even in [Admincity](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/admincity.html>), the shock waves triggered political chaos: the dictator [NAIRO](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/nairo.html>) fled the capital, and the [Cybernetic Imperium](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1221>) appeared to be collapsing.

As dust and ash settle over the desert ruins, one question remains - was this the culmination of the Deltan war, or only the beginning of their world domination?

## <a id="eon1313"></a>Eon 1313 - The 3rd Siege of Neuropolis

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>)

After successfully sabotaging the _Brothers'_ attempts to maneuver in the surrounding lands, the citizens of [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) still felt unsafe but remained hopeful nonetheless.

All their hopes came crashing down when, early in the siege, a defensive special operation by the _Minds_ was intercepted by the _Deltans_ and turned to their advantage. Temporary chaos ensued among the MindTech defenders, causing them to quickly lose ground to the attackers.

Despite suffering heavy losses, the defenders cleverly outmaneuvered the _Deltans_, grinding them down and disrupting their supply lines.

MindTech planned an immense comeback, launching another, even larger special operation. Once again, until the last moment, it was unclear whether the defenders would pull it off. 

However, they failed. The _Deltans_, with significant help from the [Cybernetic Imperium](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1221>) loyalists, once again hijacked the special operation and turned it to their favour.

This was a heavy blow to the _Minds_. Reportedly, the Council of Minds sat in stunned silence for several hours before ordering the evacuation of the city.

Shortly after, the _Brothers_, led by their leader [T](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/t.html>), breached the inner walls of the city, torching and plundering everything in sight. There were reports of attacks on fleeing civilians, looting, and the destruction of iconic Neuropolis landmarks.

As the city burned and MindTech people suffered, the _Deltans_ were seen celebrating their victory, dividing the riches of the ancient city among themselves and their _Cybernetics_ supporters.

## <a id="eon1306"></a>Eon 1306 - Stoic Defense of A'as Forest

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

[Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) attacked [A'as Forest](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/aas_forest.html>), having no other options to continue the ongoing assault on _MindTech Institute_ lands.

The attack was greatly anticipated by the defenders, who prepared a strong defense with the help of [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) and [Fighters Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>).

From the early hours of the battle, it was clear that the defenders were in a strong position, and the attackers did a bad job at preparing for the battle, which resulted in a crushing defeat for [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>).

Desperate troops of _Cybernetics Inc_ were seen fleeing the battlefield on several occasions, while the bulk of the two [Deltan factions](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) stayed away from engaging in the battle, which was a clear sign of their unwillingness to support _Cybers_ in this fight.

The biggest challenge for the defenders was an unexpected spill-over of [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) from the nearby [Oblivion Mire](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/oblivion_mire.html>), which was a constant threat to the defenders' positions. However, the _Minds_ employed a significant forced from the _Fighters Guild_ to hold the line and prevent the _Corruption_ from overwhelming their positions.

Controversially, some of the [Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brothers.html>) were seen sabotaging anti-CR measures and actively helping it spread further into _MindTech_ lands - never before seen, but hugely controversial tactic.

## <a id="eon1293"></a>Eon 1293 - The 3rd Defense of Webified Hills

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) (combined faction forces)

The [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) returned, to the [Webified Hills](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/webified_hills.html>), stronger than ever.

Following the recent [Masterful Defence](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1200>), all strategic plans were already in place and executed with near perfection once again.

It's worth noting that the [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) made up the majority of the fighting force on site, far outnumbering the region's actual owners - [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) - and providing crucial support.

In the later hours of the battle, the defenders experienced a shortage of manpower. However, under the joint supervision of the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) and the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>), the fight against the _Corruption_ was won once more.

## <a id="eon1286"></a>Eon 1286 - Fierce Defense of Paradox Pass

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

The [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) and [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) alliance pushed further east to attack the central land of the [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) - [Paradox Pass](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/paradox_pass.html>).

This region hadn't seen a major battle in a long time - [for 884 eons](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0402>), in fact - and had been considered the peaceful heartland of the Institute.

It was widely assumed that by this stage of the war, the Institute was on the verge of collapse and wouldn’t mount much of a defense.

However, the defenders launched a highly effective and surprising special operation, outsmarting the attackers and gaining an early advantage in the battle.

Such a strong defense was unexpected, and the attackers were forced to regroup to prevent their frontline from collapsing.

The offensive shifted from a blitz to an endurance battle. While the defenders held their ground impressively, they were ultimately overwhelmed by the attackers' superior numbers.

Time will tell whether this was the Institute's final spark of resistance - or the beginning of a strategic resurgence that could shift the course of the war.

## <a id="eon1280"></a>Eon 1280 - Deltans Strike Back in Brickland Fortress

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

After a rather meek effort by the [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) in their [previous attack](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1272>), it was apparent that the [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) would not pass up their chance to retaliate.

The two Deltan factions launched a joint attack on the [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>) in an effort to get close to the Silvan capital once again.

The defenders managed to organize a much stronger resistance than expected after their earlier failure. By some accounts, the armies showed roughly equal strength.

This made alliances even more crucial, and here [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) could have played a major role.

The Cybers struggled to maintain their friendly political stance toward both sides - Protectores Silva being their long-time ally, and Delta Collective a key supporter in the war against MindTech.

In the end, the Cybers assisted the Silvan defense, but either failed - or perhaps chose not - to gather a sizeable enough force to turn the tide of battle.

The result was a shaky Deltan victory. However, they managed to capture the southern part of the region and established a land connection to the Silvan capital.

![Battle Map](https://zeithalt.github.io/t/m/eon1280.png)


## <a id="eon1272"></a>Eon 1272 - Fruitless Attempt at Chaotic Plains

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

On the southern front, the [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) launched a daring attack on the [Chaotic Plains](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/chaotic_plains.html>).

It was a fairly expected move, with most estimating that Silvan forces were not numerous enough to take on the Deltan capital, leaving the Chaotic Plains as the only viable target.

As a result, the defenders were fully prepared to meet the invaders. While the Silvan attack was bold and powerful as ever, it wasn't enough to overcome the Deltan defenses.

On a side note, both [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) were not meaningfully represented on the battlefield, likely gathering their forces elsewhere for their own impending clash.

This disappointing outcome of the battle left many on the Island wondering if the Silvans were overreaching by doing this assault relying mostly on their own strength.

## <a id="eon1268"></a>Eon 1268 - BB gives control over Blue Screen Lagoon to CI

`⌛ Event`

The [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) transfer another captured territory to the [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>).

This move further complicates the understanding of the BB/CI dynamic for the rest of the factions, as it previously seemed that _Brothers_ strong-armed _Cybers_ into a deal by holding their capital.

Now, however, after two land trades in a row, it seems as if _Bothers_ were capturing lands specifically for the _Cybers_.

Speaking of which, the political landscape over in the remaining MindTech lands is changing too. In a new surprising development, the _Minds_ invite [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>) founder [You](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/you.html>) to lead their faction.

It remains to be seen what are the true causes and intentions of all these changes on the Island, but what seems to be certain is that the War on MindTech is far from over.

## <a id="eon1266"></a>Eon 1266 - BB gives back control over Admincity to CI

`⌛ Event`

As the events of the _War on MindTech_ continue to unfold, the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) have made another unexpected move by returning control over [Admincity](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/admincity.html>) back to the [Cybernetic Imperium](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1221>).

This clearly indicated that the _Brothers_ had some kind of deal with [NAIRO](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/nairo.html>) and the _Cybers_ for an attack opportunity against MindTech.

With this change on the map, the old _Minds_ mockery of the _Headless Empire_ is now gone, but it seems that the _Minds_ themselves are now worthy of a similar title.

With the continued loss of lands, it's rumoured that the faction experiences a vacuum of power, and the _Minds_ are now looking for a new leader to take charge of the faction.

## <a id="eon1262"></a>Eon 1262 - Invasion of Synaxos Fields

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>)

While the expected place of the next _Brothers'_ attack was [Paradox Pass](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/paradox_pass.html>), the allied Deltan and [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>)' forces instead launched a surprise attack on the [Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>).

This move essentially repeated the attack launched from Admincity a dozen eons ago, but this time even the attackers were surprised by the lack of preparation and the meek resistance from the defenders.

While the _Brothers'_ performed a vast landing along the whole coastline of _Synaxos Fields_, the Cybers were able to launch a land invasion from their enclave in neighbouring [Xyrclaox Watch](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/xyrclaox_watch.html>).

It's worth noting that for several battles in a row, [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>)'s Nex remains the main contributor to the defences of the allied Minds-Silvans forces. But there's a limit to how much he can do alone, and even the mighty Nex was unable to hold the line against the overwhelming forces of the _Brothers_.

The battle ended with yet another decisive victory for the _Brothers_, whose threat is now looming over the very MindTechs' capital city of [Neuropolis](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/neuropolis.html>).

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) (combined faction forces)

A dark night fell onto the Mire, as the hundreds of eons old saying _"Corruption never attacks Protectores Silva"_ is finally proven wrong.

The [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) does attack [Oblivion Mire](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/oblivion_mire.html>) and the [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) is forced to have the first-hand experience of dealing with the [corruption outburst](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_fallout.html>).

The event results in devastation and chaos throughout the region, outbursts popping up everywhere, leaving no land safe from it.

During a long and exhausting battle, the factions once again are able to unite against the common threat despite the mutual hatred and rivalry.

At a great cost, yet another outburst is contained, but it only means one thing - the next one, even more powerful, is just around the corner.

## <a id="eon1244"></a>Eon 1244 - Loss of Blue Screen Lagoon

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>)

As the major events of the _War on MindTech_ unfold, another part of the plan is put into action.

The [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) forces, in a coordinated effort with the [Cybernetic Imperium](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1221>), launch an attack on the [Blue Screen Lagoon](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/blue_screen_lagoon.html>) in a battle known as _Loss of Blue Screen Lagoon_.

It is believed that the attack was a part of the plan to take over the [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) and its assets, as well as to secure a foothold in the region.

The former _Cybers'_ capital served as a launch point for the attack, and the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) forces were able to quickly overwhelm the defenders.

Despite a solid pushback from the defenders at the end of the battle, all they managed to do is to secure some parts of the Blue Screen - Paradox Pass border. However, a small portion of it still remained under the control of the _Brothers_ with a potential for future in-land attacks.

## <a id="eon1236"></a>Eon 1236 - Fake Liberation of Admincity

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>)

In this battle, [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)
attempts to call for an uprising in [Admincity](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/admincity.html>) against recently declared [Cybernetic Imperium](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1221>).

The former CI capital was still under control of [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>), for which the Imperium was mockingly dubbed as "Headless Empire".

However, during the battle it became fully clear that this configuration of power was intentionally installed by CI/BB alliance, and the battle turned out a mere show of force to demonstrate the power of the new government.

As a result of [NAIRO](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/nairo.html>)'s firm grip on the faction, citizens of [Admincity](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/admincity.html>) were not willing to join the uprising, and instead, many of them were actively fighting against the attackers.

Any attempts to instigate a rebellion were swiftly crushed by the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) forces, and the battle ended with a decisive victory for the _Brothers_.

## <a id="eon1227"></a>Eon 1227 - Lucrative Battle of Xyrclaox Watch

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

The newly formed [Cybernetic Imperium](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1221>) delivers on its intention and attacks [Xyrclaox Watch](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/xyrclaox_watch.html>) in a battle known as _Lucrative Battle of Xyrclaox Watch_.

[MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>), not being involved in any battles for 384 eons was thought to be an easy target. However, an unexpected force has entered the battlefield and altered the balance of power.

[Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) has been "woken up" by the heavy battle activity, and it resulted in the first ever human-made [outburst](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_fallout.html>) in the history of _Zeithalt_.

This brought a lot of confusion and disorganization to the early part of the battle, hindering the attacking efforts to a great extent.

It is not fully known why the Emperor NAIRO chose a neutral faction as his target, however prolonged stay of [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) in former CI capital and their presence in battle are believed to be involved in the decision.

The battle ended with a decisive victory for the _Minds_, but it came at literally a great cost. The paycheck from the [Fighters Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>) it believed to be on par or even greater than the entire budgets of some factions.

## <a id="eon1221"></a>Eon 1221 - NAIRO Declares Cybernetics Imperium

`⌛ Event`

In an unexpected turn of events, [NAIRO](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/nairo.html>) declares the formation of the _Cybernetics Imperium_ and crowns himself as its Emperor. 

This move received mixed reactions from the community, with some factions supporting the idea of a unified cybernetic empire, while others expressed concerns about the potential for tyranny and oppression.

[MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) claiming to receive direct threats from [NAIRO](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/nairo.html>) and his followers, dubbed the new government as "Headless Empire" due to the fact that _Cybers_ capital [Admincity](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/admincity.html>) is still under control of [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>).

At the same time, the [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) factions congratulated [NAIRO](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/nairo.html>) on his new title, and generally welcomed this change of direction.

Other factions, namely [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) and [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>) took a rather cautious stance on the matter, not issuing any statements or comments on the new government. 

It remains to be seen how this new development will affect the balance of power in the region and whether _NAIRO's_ Imperium will live up to its name.

## <a id="eon1218"></a>Eon 1218 - Toothless Battle of Chaotic Plains

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

In a retaliation attempt, [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) attacked [Chaotic Plains](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/chaotic_plains.html>) but failed to capture the region from [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>).

The battle was eerily similar to the [recent deltan attack](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1209>) - a short burst of fighting at the beginning of a battle, followed by a long period of positional movement without much action.

This battle is known as _Toothless Battle of Chaotic Plains_ due to the fact that [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) were not able to inflict any noticeable damage on the [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) and were forced to retreat.

## <a id="eon1209"></a>Eon 1209 - A Dumb Battle of Cerene Vale

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

This [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) attack on [Cerene Vale](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cerene_vale.html>) was a complete disaster. 

The attacking forces were not prepared for the strong defense of [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) and the battle was effectively lost in a matter of hours.

Two tall [Silvan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) giants stood above others - Nex and BPS, crushing all hopes and efforts of the _Deltan_ attackers. 

The almost unanimous opinion of the foolish nature of this attack has granted the battle its name - _A Dumb Battle of Cerene Vale_.

## <a id="eon1200"></a>Eon 1200 - Masterful Defence of Webified Hills

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) (combined faction forces)

As a treat of yet another [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) outburst loomed over the [Webified Hills](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/webified_hills.html>), the prospects were grim.

With the faction being able to suppress the Corruption for several battles in a row (resulting in it growing stronger and stronger), it seemed that everyone was mentally ready to accept the defeat.

However, as the battle started, the unlikely close collaboration between [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) and [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) emerged.

With the novel strategic idea provided by the Band of Brothers, Cybers managed to refine their plans and turn the tide of the battle.

The situation remained tense until the end of the second eon of the battle as few people could fully believe that the new strategy would actually work as it was shown on paper.

But it did, and spectacularly so - the factions were able to fully clear the Corruption from the Webified Hills, giving new hope for the future Outbursts.

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

In this battle _Delta Collective_ were able to continue the streak of Deltan victories and take back control of [Chaotic Plains](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/chaotic_plains.html>) from [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>).

The [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) shown strong and steady advancement, while [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) were not able to hold their ground under this pressure.

The attacking forces were simply too strong and numerous on the battlefield, ensuring the confident victory for _Delta Collective_ who were finally able to win back _Chaotic Plains_ after [150 eons of Silvan rule in the region](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1044>).

## <a id="eon1186"></a>Eon 1186 - Retreat from Cybertron Jungle

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>)

More a military exercise than a serious battle, the Retreat from Cybertron Jungle was a strategic withdrawal by the [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) from the [Cybertron Jungle](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybertron_jungle.html>).

Following the alleged, but so far unconfirmed peace deal between the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) and [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>), the CI forces were ordered to abandon the jungle and retreat to the nearby regions.

It's reported that the recent [Burning of Admincity](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1176>) was a serious morale hit for the Cybers, and the leadership decided to avoid further conflicts with the Brothers for the time being.

The details of the peace deal are still unknown, but the BB forces were seen patrolling the jungle after the CI retreat, securing the area and preventing any other factions from taking advantage of the situation.

Rumors say that Admincity handover might be on the horizon, but while CI and BB are seemingly peaceful, [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) and [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>), their respective allies, are still at odds.

With the expected attack by Deltans coming any time soon, the situation on the Island remains tense and any possible peace treaties might turn out to be short-lived.

## <a id="eon1176"></a>Eon 1176 - The Burning of Admincity

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>)


The 2nd Siege of [Admincity](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/admincity.html>) might become the pivotal battle in the ongoing war, as the formidable [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>), alongside the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>), launched an audacious assault on the CI capital.

Despite expectations of a brutal defense, CI’s resistance was surprisingly weaker than anticipated. 

The defenders struggled to coordinate their forces, and key CI commanders were absent from the battlefield, leaving the city vulnerable to the meticulously planned amphibious landing by BB and DC. 

The attacking forces executed their assault with near-perfect precision, securing a dominant position early on and maintaining control for the majority of the battle.

A key moment in the battle was the reappearance of Nex, the legendary Protectores Silva juggernaut, whose presence alone was said to be equal to a dozen soldiers. 

However, even his immense strength was not enough to turn the tide against the steady and overwhelming advance of Deltan factions.

With little effective resistance, the attackers stormed the city, plundering and razing key structures. The fall of Admincity was more than a military loss for Cybers — it was a symbolic shift in power. 

Is this the beginning of a new empire, a show of strength before eventual peace talks, or yet another sad page in the never-ending conflict?

## <a id="eon1167"></a>Eon 1167 - The Strained Defense of Peace Death Gorge

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) (combined faction forces)


The battle of [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>) saw yet another vicious assault by [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>), threatening to consume one of the most contested regions in history. 

Despite their history of dominance in the region, [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) struggled due to the **notable absence of Cybernetics Inc (CI)**, which chose to abstain from aiding in the battle. Many suspect this reluctance was due to growing fears over DC’s expanding influence and its increasing control over critical territories. 

Meanwhile, [Protectores Silva (PS)](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) offered only minor reinforcements, as their famed leader **Nex** was missing from the battlefield, leading to a weaker-than-expected response from their faction.

As the battle raged on, a rising controversy took shape. 

Some factions voiced concerns about the emerging habit of weaponizing Corruption as a tactical tool or a political lever cross-factional conflicts.

While DC successfully held their ground, the lack of collective factional unity raised questions about the true balance of power on Zeithalt.

It seems that with each passing conflict, Deltan might continues to grow, leaving their opponents wary. 

How long before the Deltan army aims at even bigger goals? 

And when that day comes, will CI and PS regret standing idle at the Peace Death Gorge?

## <a id="eon1158"></a>Eon 1158 - Uphill Battle of Cybertron Jungle

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>)

Continuing their offensive momentum, the alliance of [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) and [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) attacks the [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) stronghold in the [Cybertron Jungle](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybertron_jungle.html>).

The Jungle is rather untouched by war region in the heartlands of Cybers' territory. This land has been a symbol of Cybers' power and unity for many eons, but the recent events may have shown that the faction is not as strong as it once was.

The Brothers and Deltans were able to land a sizeable force on the ground, but they were quickly pushed back by the Cybers. What the attackers did not know is that the defence barely held together and the Cybers were on the brink of collapse.

Because of that, this strong early stan-off caused uncertainty and even some voices of desperation on _both_ sides.

Some might say that this battle was fought uphill both ways. The attackers were facing a strong defence, but the defenders were barely holding together. 

This nervous uncertainty remained in the air until the very end of the battle, when the Cybers were finally overpowered and the attackers were able to take control of the key location in the region.

## <a id="eon1147"></a>Eon 1147 - The Hard-earned Return of Peace Death Gorge

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

The battle-ridden region of [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>) was once again the stage for a fierce conflict between the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) and [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and their allies.

The Deltans, determined to take back the region, launched a massive assault on the Cybers' forces. The Cybers, however, were prepared for the attack and given the recent history - four successful defences behind their backs - they were confident in their ability to repel the Deltans.

However, the wave of euphoria that continues from Detans' recent [capital defense](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1139>) helps them to push through the Cybers' defenses and secure a decisive victory in the Peace Death Gorge.

The Cybers were forced to retreat, some of their forces scattered and lost in the chaos of the battle. 

The Deltans, on the other hand, were able to regroup and secure the region, marking a significant and long-deserved victory in their campaign.

In the aftermath of the battle, both sides are left to ponder their next moves. 

The Deltans are eager to capitalize on their recent successes, however, they're unsure if their riled up armies could keep up the pace. 

At the same time, the Cybers are taken aback by the sudden turn of events, and they're left to wonder if they can recover from these defeats to stop the Deltan advance.

## <a id="eon1139"></a>Eon 1139 - The 4th Failed Siege of Purple Deeps

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) 

After a series of unsuccessful [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) attempts at reclaiming their lands, the retaliation from [Cyber](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>)-[Silvan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) alliance finally came.

The forces descended upon the [Purple Deeps](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/purple_deeps.html>), aiming to catch the Deltan capital off guard and overwhelm the defences.

The Deltans were prepared, however, and the battle was fierce. The Cybers and Silvans were able to surround the region from three sides, but the Deltans were able to hold their ground in the heart of the region and eventually push back.

Unprecedented cooperation by Deltans and Brothers made this victory possible. 

The Cybers and Silvans were forced to retreat, and the Deltans were able to hold their capital once again. 

This victory was a significant morale boost for the Deltans, whose victories became rare lately, the most recent being the [previous defence of their capital](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1052>) almost 100 eons ago.

However, now it falls to the Deltans to prove if they can turn the tide of this war and go on the offensive.

## <a id="eon1131"></a>Eon 1131 - A Close Call in Xyrclaox Watch

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) (combined faction forces)

The longer the [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) is suppressed, the stronger it becomes.

This is the simple truth that the Island has learned many times over.

In anticipation of another outburst, this time in the [Xyrclaox Watch](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/xyrclaox_watch.html>), the factions were divided by war and in a deep crisis.

The location for this battle actually gave a glimmer of hope - the Watch being controlled by the MindTech Institute, the faction that has been somewhat neutral in the latest conflicts and could count on the support of both sides.

The battle was fierce, and the Corruption was relentless, but the combined forces of the factions managed to hold the line and stop the spread of Corruption just in time for this outburst to subside.

The Island can breathe a sigh of relief for now, but the Corruption always comes back.

## <a id="eon1123"></a>Eon 1123 - Another Failed Landing Near Virtuara Outpost

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

[Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) launched a surprised attack on the [Virtuara Outpost](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/virtuara_outpost.html>).

While it was pretty obvious that deltan attacks would continue, the location for it was a surprise. The outpost was not heavily fortified, but it was well defended by the Cybers.

The Brothers were able to land a sizeable force on the ground, but they were quickly pushed back by the Cybers.

A special support team was dedicated to restraining the [Silvan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) jaggernaut Nex. It proved to be a successful strategy on its own. However, the very same forces were dearly missed in the main battle events.

In the end, Cybers were able to push the Brothers back to their ships and force them to retreat.

It is widely believed that the response to these relentless (yet unsuccessful) Deltan attacks may be swift and decisive, but the factions first have to deal with the threat of [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) in Minds' lands.

## <a id="eon1111"></a>Eon 1111 - Desperate Battle of Peace Death Gorge

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

It was the fourth (unsuccessful) attempt by [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) factions to take back [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>) from [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) in the last 100 eons.

Desperate to push Cybers' forces away from their capital, the Deltans and Brothers used the geographical advantages of the region for a strong start of the battle. 

At one point, it seemed that DC might even take a sizeable chunk of the region, but it all changed once the legendary Silvan warrior, Nex, appeared on the battlefield.

Accounts on the battle may differ, but what is known is that Nex almost single-handedly turned the tide of the battle and pushed the Deltans back to their starting positions.

Despite deltan attacks picking up pace by the end of the battle, in the end, their territorial gains in the region were negligible and Cybers were able to hold the region under their control.

With this daring attack, Deltans have rejected the ultimatum issued by the Cybers several eons prior, and it remains to be seen how Cybers will respond to this act of defiance.

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) (combined faction forces)

[Cybertron Jungle](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybertron_jungle.html>) was the second land ever targeted by corruption on [eon 345](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0345>). 

Many things changed since then, but somehow, miraculously, this region stood peaceful for 750 eons - until now.

This battle with [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) was just as fierce as the first one, however, this time Cybers had enemy withing.

The highest level official of the faction - NAIRO - was corrupted and turned against his own people. 

Usually the victims of Corruption fall into a long coma, [some do not wake up from it](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mimb.html>), but this time was different - NAIRO was still able to control his body and mind, but his actions were not his own. 

NAIRO was able to control Corruption to some degree and direct many of its attacks at the weak spots of the defence.

The battle was fierce and very close to the last hour, however, the factions were able to come together and defeat the Corruption once again.

One notable event of this battle was Brothers and Deltans invading the southern part of the region, while Cybers were fighting Corruption in the north. This action was met with a lot of criticism from the Cybers, but in the end, it was exactly what tipped the scales in factions' favor.

It's not entirely clear how NAIRO was finally stopped, but it is believed that the [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) had something to do with it.

## <a id="eon1080"></a>Eon 1080 - Defeat at Peace Death Gorge

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

The [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) launched another assault on the [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>), determined to take back the region after their previous defeats.

However, they were nowhere near as successful as they had hoped. The Cybers were prepared for the attack and managed to repel the Deltans with ease.

The Deltans were unable to secure any significant gains and were forced to retreat in all of their several offensive operations.

As has lately become the norm, the battlefield is dominated by the Silvan giant Nex, whose efforts are compared to those of a dozen regular soldiers. He, however, was heavily supported by the solid efforts of the Cybernetic forces.

This battle was also marked by unprecedented spending of gold on mercenaries by both sides of the conflict. However, it does not seem to have influenced the outcome of the battle.

Will the Deltans keep trying to take back the Peace Death Gorge, or will they admit that this land is lost to the Cybers for the foreseeable future?

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) (combined faction forces)

This battle was met with dark anticipation, as the signs of [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) outburst in [Singularity Valley](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/singularity_valley.html>) were becoming more and more apparent.

Every Corruptuon outburst is a time of fear and uncertainty, and even more so when they happen during long-standing conflicts between factions. 

The beginning of the battle was marked by a massive surge of Corruption, which almost caught the defenders off guard. 

Notably, the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) and [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) were completely absent from the battlefield, leaving the rest of the Island's factions to deal with the thread on their own.

The fight itself was brutal, the forces of the participating faction were barely enough to hold the spread of Corruption at bay. In the closing hours of the battle it was at its bleakest - to many of the defenders it seemed that the Corruption would consume the whole Valley.

However, the combined forces persevered and the factions were victorious.

## <a id="eon1063"></a>Eon 1063 - Retaliation on Peace Death Gorge

The long-awaited retaliation from the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) came in the form of a massive assault on the [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>). The Deltans were determined to make a statement after a chain of attacks on their lands.

They were able to take an early lead in the battle, securing almost the whole region by its midpoint. The Cybers, however, managed to regroup and launch a counter-offensive that turned the tide of the battle.

This counter-attack was a well-coordinated effort that heavily relied on [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) support. 

The counter-offensive slowly but surely picked up speed and pushed Deltans almost entirely out of the region. The Deltans tried to regroup and launch a counter-counter-offensive, but it was too late and not enough to influence the course of the battle.

The Cybers managed to push the Deltans back and secure a victory in the Peace Death Gorge, defending the land once taken from the Deltans.

Now, after both sides had unsuccessful attempts to capture each other's lands, the situation on the island remains tense and uncertain.

However, the faction will soon have to put aside their differences and unite against a common enemy - the signs of imminent [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) outburst started appearing in [Singularity Valley](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/singularity_valley.html>).

After a confident [recent victory](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1044>) at Chaotic Plains, the joint forces of [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) were eager to continue their campaign. 

The next target was the Deltan capital - [Purple Deeps](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/purple_deeps.html>), an ambitious goal that nonetheless seemed achievable after the recent success.

However, the Deltans were prepared. They had fortified their defenses and were ready to repel the invaders. The Silvans and Cybers launched a massive assault, but the Deltans managed to hold their ground and at no point lost control over the battle.

In the end, attackers weren't even close to securing a victory in Purple Deeps, which hinted at a potential power shift in this war.

With the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) preparing their own retaliatory attack, everyone is eager to see how the situation will develop.

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>)

In the lead-up to the battle of [Chaotic Plains](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/chaotic_plains.html>), the [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) issued a public statement, calling out for unity and peaceful coexistence between factions.

However, when their negotiation about a military exercise fell through, it seems that higher command of the Cybers changed their mind on the matter.

While the Cybernetic forces themselves did not make a deep incursion into [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) territory, they did provide support to the [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) who did launch a full-scale invasion.

The Protectores Silva forces progressed rapidly, meeting no significance resistance from the Deltans. Although it was expected that Deltans were hiding some ace up their sleeve for the last day of the battle, it seems that they were caught off guard by the magnitude of the attack, and their response never came.

The Protectores Silva forces managed to secure the Chaotic Pains in their entirety and hold their ground till the of the battle - marking a significant victory for the Silvans.

It was a long-anticipated victory, as Silvans made their first attempt to capture Chaotic Plains almost 200 eons ago and were very persistent in it. 

On their 4th attempt, the region finally fell.

Despite the recent chain of battles between DC/BoB on one side and Cybers/Silvans on the other - the factions have come together to face a common threat in the [Dev Null Marsh](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/dev_null_marsh.html>).

The defense was hard, but consistent and methodical work by the combined forces has managed to contain the threat and prevent it from spreading further.

This deep collaboration between factions has been a pleasant surprise to many, and it's expected that this might lead to a more stable period on the island.

This was yet another attempt by [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) to claim the region of [Chaotic Plains](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/chaotic_plains.html>).

The Silvans-Cybers alliance had to fight an uphill battle against the defenders, who had the advantage of the terrain and fortifications.

But the attackers came prepared too, and the events of the battle unfolded very quickly - this proved to be one of the fastest battles in the history of the Island.

Despite quick early gains by the attackers, Deltans were able to hold their ground and stop the advance in its tracks with heavy use of artillery.

The Silvan army was forced to abandon the attack and scatter for a quick retreat.

One of the few interesting political highlights is that [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) chose to join the defenders after a long period of neutrality.

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

As expected, after the recent defeat in the [Battle of Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1007>), the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) has made a move to reclaim the region of [Ares Gardens](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/ares_gardens.html>) from [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>).

The battle was fierce and bloody, with the attackers taking an early lead, but then getting bogged down in the defence trenches put up by the Silvans.

In the end, the attackers were able to break through with a risky special operation and take control of the region.

This battle will also be remembered as the first ever case of the [King of Zeithalt](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/king_of_zeithalt.html>) using their divine power to directly intervene in the affairs of the Island.

## <a id="eon1007"></a>Eon 1007 - Futile Battle at Peace Death Gorge

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

The [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) in close alliance with [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) have made a bold move to attack the [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>) in an attempt to take control of the region.

However, the battle is futile and uneventful, the effort of the attackers is ill-prepared, and the defenders are well fortified. 

The Cybers are able to stand their ground and keep the land they captured in previous conquests.

Overall, the battle was borderline boring. 

The only bit of controversy is [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>), seemingly out of nowhere, cancelling their auction on the Brothers and siding with Cybers instead. But even that goes largely unnoticed.

It's expected that the Deltans might make their move soon, but it's unclear if they will be able to make a difference in the region.

## <a id="eon0997"></a>Eon 997 - Failed Siege of Purple Deeps

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

For the second time in the history of this great city, the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) have successfully defended the [Purple Deeps](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/purple_deeps.html>) from a siege by the [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>).

And if the [first attempt, made 386 eons ago](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0611>) was a weak effort and was easily fended off by Deltans, this time the Cybernetics Inc have shown a remarkable improvement in their tactics and coordination.

The battle was well prepared by Cybers securing both [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>) and [Fighters Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>) contracts at unprecedented rates; preparing the siege tactically and logistically; and even using the [CR Shards](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_shards.html>) to their advantage.

But the Deltans were ready, the city was well fortified and the defenders were well prepared.

The siege promised to be long and bloody, however, soon after its start both sides engaged in heavy artillery fire and the Cybers were eventually forced to retreat.

Rumors say that by placing so high stakes on this battle, the Cybers have lost a significant portion of their resources and money and are now in a vulnerable position.

However, it remains unclear if the Deltans will use this opportunity to strike back or they themselves are recovering after a costly victory.

## <a id="eon0988"></a>Eon 988 - Recapture of Illusion Cliffs

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

After [the recent restoration efforts](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0980>) in the [Illusion Cliffs](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/illusion_cliffs.html>) made it possible, [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) are restoring order in the region.

Despite having no significant tactical advantage, [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) for the third battle in a row show remarkable power and coordination, showing that it's sprawl on the map of Zeithalt is well deserved.

Upon the recapture, [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) organizes the resettlement effort, greatly aided by continued support from the other factions. 

The region is slowly returning to normal life, but lost lives and the destruction of the region will not be forgotten.

## <a id="eon0980"></a>Eon 980 - Restoration of Illusion Cliffs is complete

`⌛ Event`

In another feat of global cooperation, the factions are able to fast-track the lengthy and costly process of restoring the [Illusion Cliffs](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/illusion_cliffs.html>) region after the [Corruption Outburst](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_fallout.html>) of [Eon 969](./eon0969.html) and complete it in record time.

The region is now declared safe to inhabit again and the population is slowly returning to their homes.

## <a id="eon0977"></a>Eon 977 - Anti-CR Training in the Blue Screen Lagoon

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

For the first time ever [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>) do not pass on the attacking opportunity and for a good reason. 

This military exercise serves as a way for factions to gather up new recruits after many have been lost in the recent [Corruption Outburst in the Illusion Cliffs](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0969>).

This battle also gave start to the [Restoration Project](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_restoration_project.html>) - many of those participating in the battle were swiftly redeployed to the affected areas to help with the recovery efforts.

However, this battle did not escape it's own share of controversy as the [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) were reportedly accused by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) of conspiring to set up an actual attack on their land during the training.

In the end, it seems, the differences were settled (or have never been there) and the battle was fought as planned.

## <a id="eon0969"></a>Eon 969 - Loss of the Illusion Cliffs

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>)

Yet another [Corruption Outburst](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_fallout.html>) happens in [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) lands.

Unfortunately, this time the combined faction forces were not able to contain it and [Illusion Cliffs](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/illusion_cliffs.html>) region is lost to it.

As the result of the ensuing _Corruption Fallout_ the region stands uninhabitable, many iconic sites like [Archives of Subconsciousness](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/archives_of_subcon.html>) and [Cave of Mirrors](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cave_of_mirrors.html>) now lay in ruins, and the population has to flee their homes.

Many notable warriors of all factions suffered severe Corruption poisoning and are now in critical condition.

After an unsuccessful attempt in [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>), the young faction is attempting a new start in a completely different location on the map.

The political situation in this new region is different, but with new opportunities also come new challenges.

It remains to be seen how the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) will fare in their new home.

## <a id="eon0962"></a>Eon 962 - Hijacking of the Brickland Fortress

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

[Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) joins [Silvan's](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) attack on [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>) and launches 
an unexpectedly strong blitz attack. 

The siege unfolds lightning-fast - with the use of heavy artillery and a successful special operation Cybers forces take the capital city of [Meadowridge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/meadowridge.html>) under their control. 

Soon after the capture, the attacking side makes the decision to raze the city.

Heavy fires and plundering begin on the streets of Meadowridge as the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) forces retreat from the area.


Civilians and bandits alike flee the city in terror as the Cybers go house by house and put all suspected Brothers' supporters to the sword, the torch and occasional blaster shot.

Not too long after, the city lays in ruins.

Ashes cover the empty shells of burnt out buildings like snow.

Once bustling streets and markets stay empty... as if the city has become a mere ghost of its former self.

Meadowridge will likely never have any supporters of the Brothers' again, but at what cost?

`⌛ Event`

After extensive and secretive preparations, the founders of the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) finally come out in the open as the newest faction on the Island.

A group of renown Deltan warriors - *INK*, *T*, *Macmep*, *40* and *Кіт муркіт* set on a path to lead the faction.

After a short, but destructive war between [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) and [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) the region of [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>) lay in ruins and disorder.

A Deltan task force was sent out to clean up the unlawful mess here. It seems they might have done their job a little bit too well... for they were able to bring order to this region and build a new administration here.

A one that has grown so powerful that it fell out of the control of the Deltan central power.

Today [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) officially transfers Brickland Fortress under the governance of the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>).

Will the newest power on the Island bring peace to these war-torn lands? Or will it disappear just as quickly as it appeared on the Island?

Only the time will tell.

## <a id="eon0955"></a>Eon 955 - Frustrating Battle of Mt. Pickles

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>)

Of course, frustration is a part of any battle, but this battle for [Mt.Pickles](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mt_pickles.html>) was particularly frustrating for [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) as they saw the complete turnaround of their former ally [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>).

This battle marked a potential end of Minds' neutrality policy, with them clearly favouring Protectores Silva in this battle.

Even though the Deltans were able to put up an impressive fight to retake (formerly) their land, the combined forces of all other factions were able to confidently defend it.

## <a id="eon0946"></a>Eon 946 - Expensive Battle of Ares Gardens

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

In a daring move, [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) has managed to take control of [Ares Gardens](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/ares_gardens.html>) from [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>).

The battle was unprecedentedly expensive from Cybers' point of view, and quite lucrative - from the Fighters Guild's perspective. 

Some reports show that [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) treasury lost upwards of 7000 gold coins on the services of just four men.

Another curious moment was the declared neutrality of [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) being extended to not supporting [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) defensive efforts in this battle - leaving a very bitter taste in the mouths of the former allies.

In the end, the attackers outnumbered the defenders 2 to 1 and were hugely successful in this battle.

[Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>) faced an unprecedented 4th outbreak of [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>).

Despite floating rumours of factions plotting another huge conflict on the island, they were yet another time successful in uniting in the face of ever-growing threat.

The combined forces have managed to contain the outbreak and prevent it from spreading further, narrowly avoiding a disaster that could have had catastrophic consequences for the whole island.

## <a id="eon0924"></a>Eon 924 - Explosive Battle of Brickland Fortress

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

While Deltans were still recovering after the previous devastating loss, nobody expected any surprises from this battle. 

The Deltans, however, managed to surprise everyone by launching a sudden attack on the [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>) - a stronghold of the [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>).

At first, the battle played out more or less as expected, with the Deltans slowly but surely creeping their way though the initial advantage of the Silvan defenders.

However, the last third of the battle saw a remarkable turn of events as the heavy use of bombs and artillery began on both sides.

In the unprecedented shelling of the positions, the Deltans managed to break through the Silvan defenses and capture the fortress.

In this battle, every little detail mattered and up until the very last minute it wasn't clear who would prevail.

## <a id="eon0914"></a>Eon 914 - Resourceful Battle over Peace Death Gorge

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

In this battle, an unexpected attack by the Cybers catches Deltans off guard in the [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>).

Shortly after the battle breaks out, the cybers unveil their secret weapon: a massive special operation starts in which both sides spend truly enormous amounts of resources.

By some estimates, the resources spent in this single battle are about the same as the total resources collected over the whole island in the last 90 eons.

This can only be described by both sides of the conflict falling deep into the sunk cost fallacy. Several reports say that both CI and DC are now in a state of complete resource exhaustion. 

However, this battle is not without winners, as there are rumours of some other factions making a fortune in the process by selling resources to the warring sides.

## <a id="eon0893"></a>Eon 893 - The Blunder on PEBKAC Peak

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

Reports before the battle said that previous [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) loss [in Admincity](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0884>) was more or less planned event and that the bulk of their armies had already been focusing on a new target.

Among the cited possible targets, the [Silvan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) lands were mentioned the most. 

The Silvans, however, were not idle too and prepared for the incoming attack by joining forces with [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) to set up the ambush in [Cybertron Jungle](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybertron_jungle.html>) - the least defended land of the Silvans.

This move seemingly confused Deltan leadership, who were getting conflicting reports about the situation in Cybertron Jungle and mistook it as preparation for future CI action against them.

As a result, the Deltans attempted to outmaneuver Cyber forces by attacking the PEBKAC Peak instead and were greeted by a much larger force than they expected, which included their former allies - the [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>).

It is generally agreed that the Deltans would have had a much easier time fighting [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) in the east instead, and many see this attack as a strategic blunder made by Deltan generals.

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

It's unknown what happened behind the scenes in this battle, but seemingly everyone has turned on [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) that evening. 

Even their allies, the [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>) - the very same army who took the city some 40 eons prior and ceded it to Deltans, were now seen among the attacking forces.

The attacking army was massive and overwhelming. They were able to surround the city and breach the gates with the help from locals who happily greeted them on the streets. 

Instead of a planned long siege, the attackers were able to take the city in a matter of hours, sending Deltan forces on the run.

The citizens of Admincity celebrate on the streets, but the tensions on the island are only growing: it's unclear what the new [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) stance is, and the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) still has the biggest army that could regroup and strike back at any time.

In this battle, the Deltan and Minds alliance stand strong together, however, contrary to the last battle good preparation and timing pays off for the Silvans.

They algo get significant support from the [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) resulting in a much more balanced battle.

In the end, the Deltans and Minds are able to hold their ground and push back the attackers, but many attribute their success to the bad diplomatic preparation by the Silvan leadership. 

Their faction did not secure support of neither the [Fighters Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>) nor the [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>) for this battle.

## <a id="eon0864"></a>Eon 864 - The Victory of Peace Death Gorge

`⚔️ Battle` won by Delta Collective (combined faction forces)

The [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) returns to [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>).

The combined faction forces are quickly railed up together to temporarily abandon their differences and focus on the common threat. 

As lately became the norm, the Corruption battle is long and brutal, but factions manage to push it back to its source. 

The [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>) stands free from Corruption.

## <a id="eon0856"></a>Eon 856 - The Foolish Battle of Chaotic Plains

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

In retaliation to previous joint [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) and [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) attacks, [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) launched a surprise attack on the [Chaotic Plains](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/chaotic_plains.html>).

However, this battle was destined to fail from the start. 

The [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) stays the major power on the Island, on top of that they had the contract with the [Fighters Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>) to provide additional support. Minds forces also joined the defence with the [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>) on their side.

From the attacking side it was only Silvans, Cybers, and a few independent Sellsword groups.

The battle was an honorable strike back from [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) to show their determination, but it was still a defeat.

There was nothing foolish in their actions, the battle simply got this name because it happened shortly before the Fool's Day.

## <a id="eon0843"></a>Eon 843 - The Fall of Admincity

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

The alliance between Minds and [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) stands strong for another battle.

This time these factions strike a deal - [MT receives Virtuara Outpost](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0842>) just in time to launch a surprise attack on [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) capital - [Admincity](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/admincity.html>).

In return, the Minds provide the Deltans support, in both, troops and resources to take over the capital.

When the fighting breaks out, it catches Cybers completely off guard. The city is not prepared for a full-scale assault, and the defenders are quickly overwhelmed.

In the effort to save the situation, Cybers coordinate with [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) to launch a costly special operation, but it is met with even greater resistance from the Deltans.

In the end, the city falls, and the Deltans take control of the capital upon their agreement with the Minds.

Notably, the Deltan army decides not to plunder the city, leaving it mostly intact and vulnerable to potential counter-attacks.

The fall of Admincity is a significant blow to the Cybers, and it is yet to be seen how they will respond to this loss.

## <a id="eon0836"></a>Eon 836 - Successful Landing near Virtuara Outpost

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

After a previous attempt more than [300 eons ago](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0501>), many thought that the sea attack on the [Virtuara Outpost](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/virtuara_outpost.html>) could not succeed.

However, [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) managed to surprise the defenders and land a significant force on the shores of the Outpost.

Once again, the Deltan forces supported by a smaller [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) force completely dominated the battlefield.

Even though [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) were prepared for the attack, got the help from their [Silvan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) allies and hired the support of the [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>), the sheer number of Deltan troops was simply overwhelming.

While the further plans of the Deltan commanders are unknown, the _Virtuara_ provides them an excellent strategic position to launch further attacks on the _Cybers'_ territory. It opens up such possibilities as a direct attack on [Admincity](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/admincity.html>) or a push deeper into CI territory, cutting off their capital from the supply lines.

## <a id="eon0825"></a>Eon 825 - A Near Miss at Paradox Pass

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) (combined faction forces)

This event had its share of drama and controversy both before and during the battle.

The defence was to happen right after the highly controversial [Blitz Battle of the A'as Forest](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0818>), and the Minds were still under heavy criticism for their actions from Cybers and Silvans. 

In the wake of the calls for ignoring the [Corruption outburst](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) and letting the [Paradox Pass](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/paradox_pass.html>) fall victim to it, the Institute employed their propaganda and diplomatic resources to the maximum.

As a result, the battle was long and tense as the factions persevered through the night. It was decided only in the few last minutes - as a victory for combined faction forces.

It did not go unnoticed that both Cybers and Silvans refused to give the battle monetary support despite repeated MindTech calls for it and promise to cover the costs after the battle.

The disaster of Corruption was avoided this time, but the Island still stands highly divided and many questions between the factions are left unresolved. 

Some of them may bear a threat no less existential than the Corruption itself.

## <a id="eon0818"></a>Eon 818 - Blitz Battle of the A'as Forest

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

It was a quick and decisive battle in here the attacking MindTech forces were ahead of their opposition by a colossal margin.

First of all, Minds prepared greatly for this battle, and attacked [A'as Forest](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/aas_forest.html>) from three sides simultaneously, almost trapping the opposing [Silvan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) and [Cybernetics'](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) troops in the process.

Secondly, _Minds_ were able to secure contracts with both [Fighters' Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>) and [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>) to further increase their numbers.

Lastly, [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) - who are currently considered to have the strongest army on the Island - once again proved to be a reliable ally and provided them with the necessary support.

As a result, the battle was decided in a matter of hours - the attackers had vastly superior force, and the battle was finished quickly.

## <a id="eon0810"></a>Eon 810 - Grinding Battle of Peace Death Gorge

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

In this battle, factions (especially Deltans) fought for every inch of the land in the [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>) to reclaim it.

The Delta Collective had done a lot of preparations and had a lot of experience in the area, so they were able to get the early lean which only grew as the battle moved forward.

In fact, the force with which the Deltans fought here made the other factions' efforts pale in comparison - the Delta Collective is estimated to have gathered a bigger army than all four other factions _combined_.

Such an immense force was not only able to secure this land, but also made the people across the Island talk about the current balance of power and its meaning for future battles.

## <a id="eon0802"></a>Eon 802 - Military Exercise in the Dev Null Marsh

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

Factions are conducting a military exercise in the [Dev Null Marsh](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/dev_null_marsh.html>) in the wake of the upcoming [CR Restoration Project](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_restoration_project.html>) in nearby [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>) and to prepare for future Corruption outbreaks. 

The [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) wins the exercise, showing the best coordination and tactics.

Shortly after the exercise, the factions complete back-to-back all three necessary _CR Restoration Project_ stages and the land is announced to be free from [corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>).

With that, the full restoration is far from over as such notable places as [Volcanic Jacuzzi](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/volcanic_jacuzzi.html>) and [Jurassic Part](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/jurassic_park.html>) were heavily damaged and still in need of attention.

## <a id="eon0793"></a>Eon 793 - The Mourning of Peace Death Gorge

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>)

Despite all the preparation and the effort, a long period of factions being able to contain the thread of _Corruption_ has ended.

[Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>) is uninhabitable, and the [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) are forced to evacuate the population.

Many people suffered exposure to _Corruption_ and are being hastily transported to the [CURE](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cure.html>) facilities for treatment.

Due to continuous suppression of _Corruption_, this [fallout](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_fallout.html>) seems to be much more violent and factions are not able to initiate the Containment phase of [CR Restoration Project](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_restoration_project.html>) for a long time. 

As, sadly, became a routine procedure - [Bank of Zeithalt](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/bank_of_zeithalt.html>) reinstates its restrictive policies on the Island's economy.

`⌛ Event`

After eons of preparations, the founders of the [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>) finally finish the process of establishing their new faction.

The faction is founded by the three former [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) Masters - [Bumps](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/bumps.html>), [Shaxx](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/shaxx.html>) and [CrAEX](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/craex.html>), joined by a Silvan [You](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/you.html>) and a sellswords [Eldar](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/eldar.html>) and [Revalx](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/revalx.html>).

The new faction is able to negotiate a deal with MindTech regarding the [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>) and now has it under their control.

The goal of the Cloudy Operatives is claimed to be the focus on the development of the Desert and its [resources](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/temporal_resources.html>), as well as trade and economic prosperity. 

In their founding accords, the new faction vows not to take interest in any lands outside the Desert with the goal of achieving neutrality with other factions.

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) (combined faction forces)

After the previous war and the tension it caused between the factions, the defense of [Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>) promised to be hard. 

There even were rumors of intentional sabotage against MindTech Institute efforts.

The fact that the faction had been suppressing [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) for several battles in a row did not help either.

However, the factions were able to gather a strong united force to aid MindTech Institute in the defense and avoid the global disaster.

## <a id="eon0768"></a>Eon 768 - Hesitant Battle of Peace Death Gorge

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

Without question, this battle turned out to be quite predictable and uneventful.

First off, [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) could only attack one Deltan land - [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>).

For that reason, all Deltan forces were concentrated in that region, giving Deltans the great advantage that they managed to keep for the entirety of the battle.

All allies were predictable too - same as for many battles prior, [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) were on _Deltans_ side, while [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) supported [Cybers'](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) attack. 

However, what granted the battle its name - is the hesitance and drama CI reportedly had with rumored preparation for attacking the [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>) - and the attack on it being called off at the last moment with Cybers changing their minds about it several times.

It's said, that what made them to change their minds in the end was the promised creation of a new faction in the Timeless Desert, and that the battle there could've undermined their peaceful separation process from [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>).

However, there were no official statements about this from any faction neither during nor after the battle.

## <a id="eon0766"></a>Eon 766 - PS rebuilds capital in Cerene Vale

`⌛ Event`

Following the [Burning of Cerene Vale](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0749>), the subsequent [changes](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0755>) in [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) and the [exchange of lands](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0761>), [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) begin rebuilding their capital in Cerene Vale.

With that, comes a logical conclusion of the MT-PS war.

The result of this war seems to be [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) losing a couple of their lands and having to rebuild their capital.

[Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>), lost Dev Null Marsh back to Deltans.

[MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) were able to reclaim one of their lands at a high cost of losing vast amounts of resources and ended up with a new government to navigate the political situation they put themselves in.

[Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) are the main benefactors of the war after reclaiming Ares Garden and squeezing out Silvans from the Imperial Swamp without major changes in their inner and outer politics.

But is it really the end of the war? Or is it just the beginning of a new chapter?

## <a id="eon0759"></a>Eon 759 - The Festive Battle on the Marshes

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

During the holidays celebrated across the Island, but not in the Deltan lands, the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) launch enormous and unexpected attack on [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) in [Dev Null Marsh](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/dev_null_marsh.html>).

The [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) are caught completely off guard. 

Their defences in the region are crippled by the very first strike, and even their allies [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) - being worn down and demoralized by [their own recent losses](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0749>) -  are unable to gather an army to come to the aid.

As the result, [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) glide through this battle with almost no resistance and reclaim the land that once belonged to them.

The second-best army on the battlefield was surprisingly the [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>), who were able to put up a good effort towards DC victory, despite [the turbulent times their faction goes through](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0755>).

The fact that this battle happened during the holiday season granted it a special name - _The Festive Battle on the Marshes_.

## <a id="eon0755"></a>Eon 755 - Council of Minds is restored in MT

`⌛ Event`

Following the blatant and brutal [Burning of Cerene Vale](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0749>), the [Loki](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/loki.html>)'s fall and simultaneous restoration of democratic institutes in MindTech begin.

At the same time as democratic and inclusive elections are announces in [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>), the former tyrant leader is detained and held captive in [Prefrenial Prefect](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/prefrenial_prefect.html>), awaiting a trial. 

The elections result in a landslide victory for [CuriousDino](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/curious_dino.html>), who immediately assumes office as the MT Head of State and reestablishes the [Council of Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/council_of_minds.html>) as the governing body of MindTech. 

Following eons become very busy for the newfound government: the new government structure is approved by the absolute majority of the Council; several cross-faction proposals are put forward and voted on; Loki is transferred to [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) for trial.

While from the outside of the faction these changes are barely noticeable and the faction still struggles to find understanding from other factions, the internal changes seem to be drastic and ambitious. 

Which begs the ultimate question - will it start a new, more peaceful era for MindTech, or will it collapse back into the war and destruction yet again?




## <a id="eon0749"></a>Eon 749 - The Burning of Cerene Vale

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

A devastating loss for [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) results in them having to flee their own capital, as it goes up in flames from the approaching [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>) army attacks.

The MT dictator [Loki](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/loki.html>) stops at nothing to get his revenge on the [Protectors](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) for what he calls a betrayal.

It's a second ever successful siege of a capital, and the first one where the attacking army decides to burn the city to the ground. 

Historians will remember this event as the _Burning of Cerene Vale_, and estimate that it might bear the same significance for the whole island as [Siege of Neuropolis (eon 384)](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0384>) and the [Disaster of Synaxos Fields (eon 508)](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0508>).

When the ash settles and the smoke clears, will the [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>) army march on to their next target? 

Or will the [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) be able to regroup and fight back?

Whichever way it goes, at the moment it seems the only way forward is through even more bloodshed and destruction.

As it happened many times previously, the existential threat of [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) is able to unite factions - even if temporarily - to fend off the greater danger.

We see it happen again this time - despite an ongoing war between the [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>) and [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans>) on one side and [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) with [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) on the other.

It was a long an enduring battle through the night, however the factions were able to hold their ground and push back the [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>).

Notably, [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) had the strongest army on the battlefield, being almost equal to the combined forces of three other factions.

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>)

This battle was long anticipated by both sides, but [Loki](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/loki.html>) took his time to strike at an unexpected time and in an unexpected place... 

However, [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) were ready for that: they had their defenses distributed equally over their lands, and [A'as Forest](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/aas_forest.html>) had formidable defenses.

With [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>), [Silvan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) and the [Fighters Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>) on one side, and [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) with [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>) on the other, this battle was going to be a close one.

Despite quickly losing the initiative and all the chaos that ensued, [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) managed to keep their heads cool and with a considerable effort and unforeseen amount of resources were able to fend off the attack.

After failing to secure a contract with [Fighters Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>), [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) return to their previous tactic of sabotaging the [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>).

This tactic proves useful again, as the Cybers are able to trigger [CR Mines](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_mines.html>) and interrupt [Temporal Resource](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/temporal_resources.html>) production in the region.

However, the battle itself was heavily dominated by [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) forces helping MT defend, while Cybers and Silvans mostly conserved their forces for the upcoming MT retribution.

## <a id="eon0715"></a>Eon 715 - The Unfriendly Battle of Blue Screen Lagoon

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>)

_Protectores Silva_ attacks [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) and captures [Blue Screen Lagoon](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/blue_screen_lagoon.html>).

This battle seemingly caught _MindTech Institute_ off guard as their performance in the battle was “poor” at best.

Initially meeting a strong defensive action form [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>), _Protectores Silva_ backed up by _Cybers_ and the [Fighters Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>) persisted as the battle lasted into the night where its fate was decided.

Due to previously friendly relations between _Minds_ and _Silvans_, this battle was named _The Unfriendly Battle of Blue Screen Lagoon_.

## <a id="eon0706"></a>Eon 706 - The Fall of Ares Garden

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

_Delta Collective_ attacks [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) to seize control over the [Ares Gardens](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/ares_gardens.html>) in a battle known as _The Fall of Ares Garden_.

This battle has two remarkable traits:
- it’s the first ever direct attack by any faction on _Protectores Silva_;
- it’s the first appearance of [Fighters Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>) in a cross-factional battle.

[Sellswords](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/sellswords.html>) in this battle dealt more damage than both [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) or [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>), clearly establishing a new powerful player on the Zeithalt map.

However, their efforts were not enough to help _Silvans_ win this battle.

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) (combined faction forces)

[Corruption Outbreak](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) in [Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>) happens, but factions being alert to the danger win by a good margin.

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

[Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) attacks [Dev Null Marsh](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/dev_null_marsh.html>), starting a battle known as _Defense of Dev Null Marsh_.

It was practically won by a clever use of _Special Tactics_ and [resources](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/resources.html>) by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>).

[Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) strikes [Chaotic Plains](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/chaotic_plains.html>) causing a _Spooky Battle of Chaotic Plains_, which, however was closely won by collective factions’ effort.

## <a id="eon0656"></a>Eon 656 - The Sabotage in the Desert

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

[Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) launches an attack on [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>)’s infrastructure in a battle known as _Sabotage in the Desert_.

As declared by the [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>), the goal of this attack wasn't to conquer the _Desert_, but rather to interrupt its production and weaken its defences.

The initial blow alone achieved both of these objectives. [Corrupted Mines](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_mines.html>) were triggered in the area, and the first attacks indeed disrupted [Temporal Resource](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/temporal_resources.html>) production for several eons.

Afterward, the pace of the attacking activity slowed significantly, and the _MindTech Institute_ in a coalition with [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) forces was able to secure victory in the battle, while [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) remained mostly neutral.

It's difficult to determine a clear "winner" in this battle, as both sides claim to have achieved their goals on the battlefield. What remains certain is that, even after seven battles, the _Desert_ still stands unconquered.

## <a id="eon0646"></a>Eon 646 - The Unstable Battle of Blue Screen Lagoon

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

[MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) attacks and wins [Blue Screen Lagoon](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/blue_screen_lagoon.html>) in a battle known as _Unstable Battle of Blue Screen Lagoon_.

A streak of unsuccessful battles for [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) continues once again, with [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>) attacking and capturing the _Lagoon_. 

Despite the help from [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) and having the upper hand for most of the battle, combined effort of _Deltans_ and _Minds_ prevailed in this battle.

## <a id="eon0636"></a>Eon 636 - The Peculiar Battle of Mt. Pickles

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

[Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) attacks and wins [Mt. Pickles](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mt_pickles.html>) in a battle known as _Peculiar Battle on Mt. Pickles_.

What gave the battle its name, is the fact that the battle seemingly stopped several times and changes into friendly conversations and even picnics between participants.

However, after some time, the fighters remembered their differences and the battle would resume.

In this battle [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) were on the defensive side (helped by their allies [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>)), while [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) lead the assault with help from the [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>).

Factions collectively stand strong against [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) in the _Enduring Defence of Webified Hills_.

This time the _Corruption_ wasn’t spreading particularly fast, but the battle was difficult and long.

Once again factions were able to come together and collectively defeat the threat.

## <a id="eon0619"></a>Eon 619 - The Reclamation of Imperial Swamp

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>)

[Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) attacks and claims [Imperial Swamp](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/imperial_swamp.html>) in a battle known as _Reclamation of the Imperial Swamp_.

After a devastating loss to [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) and the following [restoration projects](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_restoration_project.html>) the _Imperial Swamp_ stood as unoccupied and CR-free land - a chance seen and seized by the _Protectores Silva_.

Prompted by [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>), the rush to capture the _Imperial Swamp_ started, but having used the [Corrupted Shards](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_shards.html>), the _Silvans_ were ahead of others the entire battle and secured the victory.

`⌛ Event`

[Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) exchange lands upon their mutual agreement:
- [Dev Null Marsh](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/dev_null_marsh.html>) is now under control of [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>);
- [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>) is now under control of [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>).

## <a id="eon0611"></a>Eon 611 - A Picnic near The Purple Deeps

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

As a late night settles in the _Deltan_ lands, joint forces of [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) lay a siege to the Deltan capital of [Purple Deeps](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/purple_deeps.html>).

Interestingly, most _Deltan_ forces were absent or asleep at that time, so their allies from [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) had to fend off the first attacks.

In the initial hours heavy fighting breaks out, almost bringing down Deeps’ defences to an equal fight, but in an unexplainable turn of events the fighting stops in its tracks and all factions take a break for several hours.

This sudden break granted the battle its name - _A Picnic near The Purple Deeps_.

Later on, the battle resumes, but by that time full power of _Deltan_ forces were awake, joined by increased numbers of the [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>)… as a result, defenders had a comfortable lead till the very end of the battle.

## <a id="eon0596"></a>Eon 596 - The Fall of Imperial Swamp

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>)

Some say after previous easy victory over _Corruption_ the factions became too reckless. Others say heavy suppression of the _Corruption_ last time caused it being overcharged this time, resulting in uncontrollable violent outburst…

Either way, the collective effort of factions wasn’t enough and [Imperial Swamp](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/imperial_swamp.html>) falls - the land is currently uninhabitable and man-made structures, such as [Altar of Ctulhu](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/altar_of_ctulhu.html>) and [Money Factory](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/money_factory.html>), are destroyed.

[Bank of Zeithalt](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/bank_of_zeithalt.html>) has declared the Island-wide state of emergency until the necessary [CR Restoration Project](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_restoration_project.html>) stages are completed to contain the threat.

## <a id="eon0582"></a>Eon 582 - The Advance on Peace Death Gorge

In an unexpected strategic move, [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) were able to make [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) expect an attack on [Dev Null Marsh](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/dev_null_marsh.html>) and divert all their defences there, while the actual advance happened in [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>).

Due to careful planning and good execution, joint forces of [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) and [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) were able to dominate the battlefield and win this battle.

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) (combined faction forces)

Factions are able to put aside their differences and arguments to fend off [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) in the [Singularity Valley](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/singularity_valley.html>).

[Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) in coordination with other factions did a very good job preparing for the battle - [Corrupted Mines](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_mines.html>) were installed, defenses strengthened, fortifications built… it all paid off in the end.

As expected after two violent _Corruption_ outbursts, it seems to have released some of its pressure and this battle proved to be easier.

On the other hand, it means the next battle will be harder.

## <a id="eon0563"></a>Eon 563 - The 5th Battle of Mt. Pickles

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

[Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) launches an invasion in [Mt. Pickles](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mt_pickles.html>) region - a land that has been peaceful for many eons, but forces of [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) are able to stop the _Deltan_ army in its tracks.

[MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) stayed neutral in the first half of the battle, but later joined the full-scale attack on [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>).

This is the first battle on record where both sides of the conflict launched special operations to undermine each other and get tactical advantage in the battle.

Remarkable trivia - _Mt. Pickles_ has now seen more battles than any other region on Zeithalt, but the previous battle happened here almost 200 eons ago.

This is the first case on record of any faction using [Corrupted Shards](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_shards.html>) to get an advantage in the battle.

The fast-paced nature of this battle gave it the title _The Race for Oblivion Mire_.

While these lands will forever remain scarred by the disaster and every man-made structure was destroyed while the event unfolded, _Oblivion_ now stands clear from [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>).

Since all population was evacuated previously from _Oblivion Mire_, it is currently a free land, not belonging to any faction.

The immediate danger is gone, but Zeithalt will remember _The Dark Night on the Mire_ and the lessons it taught us.

[Oblivion Mire](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/oblivion_mire.html>) is uninhabitable as factions fail to contain _Corruption_.

[Bank of Zeithalt](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/bank_of_zeithalt.html>) reinstates its policies that were in order during the previous [Corruption Fallout](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_fallout.html>) to minimize the damages to the Island’s economy.

Many people suffered exposure to _Corruption_ - luckily with recent developments we know that full recovery is possible, although it will take time to heal.

Most of [Oblivion Mire](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/oblivion_mire.html>) is currently in uninhabitable state, many places just dangerous to be in due to _Corruption Fallout_.

As the last devastating news to the Islanders, renown [Valhalla Bar](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/valhalla_bar.html>) is now also destroyed.

This night will be remembered as _The Dark Night on the Mire_.

[Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) and [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) did not provide a remarkable presence on the battlefield, while [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) saw this battle as an extension of clearing out the [Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>) of the [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) and provided much more noticeable support.

[MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) had by far the most power in this battle, successfully completing _The Recapture Of Synaxos Fields_.

While these lands will forever remain scarred by the disaster and every man-made structure was destroyed while the event unfolded, Synaxos now stands clear from [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>).

Since all population was evacuated previously from [Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>), it is currently a free land, not belonging to any faction.

Many on the Island are wondering of this means a future peaceful collaboration to restore  to former glory…. or a threat of a new bloody conflict for controlling the land is looming over it.

It was quite an uneventful battle where [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) were prepared and [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) clearly did a bad job planning out this battle.

[Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) stayed neutral, while [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) quickly realised that mistakes were made and that the battle cannot be won.

The slow and frankly quite boring nature of this unsuccessful siege has granted the battle its name - _The Sleepy Siege of Cerene Vale_.

[Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>) is a dead wasteland as factions fail to contain [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) surge.

Several new [Bank of Zeithalt](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/bank_of_zeithalt.html>) policies are in order following an attempt to save the economy of the Island.

Many people suffered exposure to [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) - the fate of those with severe cases is unknown at the moment of writing.

Most of [Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>) is currently in uninhabitable state, many places just dangerous to be in due to [Corruption Fallout](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_fallout.html>).

For sure, factions will study the phenomenon in the coming eons to see if at least something is recoverable, but for now _Synaxos Fields_ is considered to be a dead land.

[MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) restore the order in the [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>)

The [Rebels](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/rebels.html>) are driven away and into hideouts after the unsuccessful attempt to install themselves as a new governing power in the desert.

Unfortunately for [Rebels](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/rebels.html>) they did not find the support of other factions to put up a good enough defence against [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>).

[Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) and [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) mostly stayed neutral, while [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) joined the efforts to quell the rebellion.

## <a id="eon0505"></a>Eon 505 - Rebels take over Timeless Desert

`⌛ Event`

[Rebels](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/rebels.html>) take over [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>), battle ensues where [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) tries to recapture it!

Rebellion group lead by [Sellswords](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/sellswords.html>): _Just No_name_, _TheDuckie_, [Eldar](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/eldar.html>) with the help of two inside men in [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) - [CuriousDino](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/curious_dino.html>) and _timmyrueben_ capture several administrative buildings and attempt to take [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>) under their control.

Immediately the fighting starts, [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>) attack back and try to drive rebels away from their lands.

## <a id="eon0502"></a>Eon 502 - The Island is getting ready for the next Corruption surge

`⌛ Event`

[MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)‘s Chamber of Corruption Research detects that the next [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) surge currently builds up in [Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>).

[Bank of Zeithalt](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/bank_of_zeithalt.html>) issues a message that it is well-prepared to face any outcome, including  outburst not being contained in [Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>). Strict monetary restrictions will be in place if this happens in order to ensure the stability of the Island’s economy.

## <a id="eon0501"></a>Eon 501 - The Failed Landing near Virtuara Outpost

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

Attack by sea and at an unusual time - [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) clearly hoped for a swift and surprising attack…

However, [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) were prepared for that: defences were ready, troops anticipated the attack.

Notable that in this battle [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) broke their long-time habit of being neutral and sided with [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) in this battle.

[MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) stayed neutral, making it a 1 vs 2 attack, with no land support.

As a result, [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) successfully fends off the [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) threat and wins _The Failed Landing near Virtuara Outpost_.

## <a id="eon0492"></a>Eon 492 - CI and MT exchange lands

`⌛ Event`

[Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)  exchange lands upon their mutual agreement:
- [Blue Screen Lagoon](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/blue_screen_lagoon.html>) is now under control of [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>);
- [Oblivion Mire](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/oblivion_mire.html>) is now under control of [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>).

With this exchange the factions also release a joint statement that they have completed the process of returning the lands to their original owners.

Will this mean an era of prosperity and peace for the two factions? Or will it be just a short break before the next conflict?

## <a id="eon0491"></a>Eon 491 - The Oblivious Battle on the Mire

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

This battle turned out to be even longer and more unremarkable than the previous one.

[Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) once again conducted another military exercise;
[Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) and [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) were mostly neutral, presumably once again been asked by two other faction to stay neutral.

All-in-all, nothing really special, except for the hilarious fact that members of MT’s government (presumably being intoxicated by the fumes of [Oblivion Mire](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/oblivion_mire.html>)) forgot to issue an official message about place and time of the attack to their troops.

This resulted in some of their forces attacking in the middle of the night, while others embarrassingly overslept the first half of the battle.

Such forgetfulness of MT officials granted this battle its title - _The Oblivious Battle on the Mire_

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

[The Watch’s](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/xyrclaox_watch.html>) defenses prepared by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) are good and attackers have to come from a narrow path to the lands… This offensive was never going to be easy.

With [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) and [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) staying near perfectly neutral, this battle dragged on even more…

Since the beginning of the battle, [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) slowly but surely were closing the gap between them and the [Mind](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>), until in a final push they were able to secure the victory.

The careful, slow and intense nature of the battle has granted it its name - _The Crawling Battle of [Xyrclaox Watch](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/xyrclaox_watch.html>)_.

## <a id="eon0469"></a>Eon 469 - The Corrupted Battle of PEBKAC Peak

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) (combined faction forces)

All major factions of Zeithalt once again were able to show great unity in fighting-off the [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) and pulled together a massive effort, narrowly winning against the ever-growing threat.

The eons leading up to the battle showed unprecedented collaborations between [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>). Factions temporarily traded lands and provided each other help in preparation for the  surge.

During the battle, [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) fought on par with [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>), while [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) were lagging a bit behind (though many attribute this to the battle starting at nighttime in Deltan time zone).

Due to the success in The Corrupted Battle of [PEBKAC Peak](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/pebkac_peak.html>) factions CR research projects move forward, giving more understanding on the nature of [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>).

## <a id="eon0466"></a>Eon 466 - CI and PS prepare for CR Battle

`⌛ Event`

As the whole Island is waiting for the next, potentially deadly, [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) strike, [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) are preparing for the upcoming battle.

They temporarily administrate each other's lands in [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>) and [PEBKAC Peak](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/pebkac_peak.html>), respectively.

Notable events that happened during the short time faction held each other’s lands:
- CI built a 🔬 Modern CR Research Facility in [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>);
- PS built fortifications in [PEBKAC Peak](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/pebkac_peak.html>).

## <a id="eon0462"></a>Eon 462 - The 2nd Siege of Neuropolis

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

Quite surprisingly, in this battle [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) - known for their chaotic and warring spirit - seemingly decided to follow [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) steps, as both these faction stayed neutral.

[Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) defending effort was good, but well outmatched by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) attacking power.

Important thing to note is that during this battle the deal between [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) and [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>) to trade [Paradox Pass](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/paradox_pass.html>) (becomes CI land) for [Illusion Cliffs](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/illusion_cliffs.html>) (goes to MT) was uncovered, raising more questions from other factions.

## <a id="eon0452"></a>Eon 452 - Technological advancement - Taxes and Land Income

`⌛ Event`

In the time between battles [Bank of Zeithalt](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/bank_of_zeithalt.html>) introduces taxes - land income and battle tax:
- battle tax is imposed upon faction members as a way to fill up faction treasuries;
- land income is collected by factions from the lands under their control.

Factions immediately started investing into their own economy by building land improvements that earn more income:
- [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) builds `💡SmartHome Tech` in [Neuropolis](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/neuropolis.html>);
- [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) builds `🌿 Photosynthetic Power Station` in [A’as Forest](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/aas_forest.html>).

## <a id="eon0451"></a>Eon 451 - The Blitz Battle of Peace Death Gorge

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

[Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) gather considerable power of own men and hired sellswords to organize a successful blitz attack on [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>), reclaiming this land back under control.

Both [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) (defending side) and [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) (staying neutral, as usual) keep very low profiles, having almost no effect on the outcome of the battle.

[MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) quite unexpectedly joins the offensive. It’s unclear if their intervention was an effort to help the [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>), or an attempt of hijacking their attack. Either way, [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>) power was not enough to contest the confident win by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>).

## <a id="eon0441"></a>Eon 441 - The Lakeside Battle of Webified Hills

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

In a stunning and unexpected attack near the [Lake Corsair](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/lake_corsair.html>), [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) reclaim their lands in _The Lakeside Battle of [Webified Hills](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/webified_hills.html>)_.

[Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) valiantly attempts to defend the territory but are ultimately unsuccessful due to bad preparation - they clearly were expecting an attack somewhere else, having almost no defense setup in the [Hills](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/webified_hills.html>).

Notable that [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) strongly supported the Cybers’ attack, however some of their members and paid sell-swords did hits helping [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) defenses too.

[Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) stayed true to their resolve of being a neutral force, hitting equally for both sides to earn some gold.

In this battle factions once again stood strong against the [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>), winning with quite a margin.

However, this battles was not without surprises - [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) forces were considerable more powerful than other factions, while [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) performance was so underwhelming, that [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) was the second best.

In this daring attack [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) severely miscalculated and misinterpreted the current situation and launched unsupported attack on [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>).

Met by the defense of all 3 other factions, this attack was destined to fail from the beginning, given this battle its title - _The Foolish Battle of Timeless Desert_.

## <a id="eon0413"></a>Eon 413 - The Battle of Legoland Fortress

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

This battle is dubbed “of Legoland Fortress” my some MT members because after two failed attempts, on the third try the [fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>) finally crumbled.

This battle questionably marks the end of [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) partnership, as [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) are left unsatisfied by [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) underwhelming participation in battle.

On the other hand, only a fraction of Cybers supported MT in this battle, what probably left [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>) unimpressed too.

The tensions are rising, alliances are shaking. It seems only [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) manages to not worsen it’s position in this battle, by keeping low profile - a position, understandable for a small and so far a peaceful faction.

[Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>) were able to defend their lands in this battle, with the help of [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) (and some [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) involvement in the end of the battle).

Worth noting that both MT garrisons were located in the area, greatly helping with defences - as if Minds wildly gambled or been informed of the attack.

This battle happened at night time for most of the participants and took longer than usual to finish, granting its name - The Night Battle of [Paradox Pass](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/paradox_pass.html>).

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) (combined faction forces)

The participation was high and battle ended rather quickly.

Due to various factors and the recent spike in activity and commitment, this battle against the [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) was less intense than the last one and many think it was won much easier this time.

Does it mean that the next time the [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) will strike harder?

## <a id="eon0384"></a>Eon 384 - The Siege of Neuropolis

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

In a dramatic battle, alliance of [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) with [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) gathered together a great force both in battle and in financial effort, and successfully conquered the heart of [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) -  their capital city [Neuropolis](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/neuropolis.html>).

Historians noticed that [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) did not immediately rushed to the aid, but joined after a few attacks - either due to the surprising nature of the attack, or they were negotiating something the [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>)…

This epic battle will be remembered in chronicles as _The Siege of Neuropolis_, first ever attack and successful capture of a faction’s capital.

When faced with a choice whether to keep the city or let Neuropolis burn to the ground, Delta Collective decided to save the city.

All the fires remaining after battle were promptly put out, the immediate restoration of city walls began, Deltan officials started the effort to restore peaceful life in the city.

With the help of [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>), the [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) were able to defend their lands the MT attack.

However, [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) sent out message to let other factions know that this was a joint military exercise with [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) and their faction is committed to their claimed goal of pursuing peace on the Zeithalt.

## <a id="eon0369"></a>Eon 369 - Protectores Silva is founded

`⌛ Event`

[Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) - a new faction emerges on Zeithalt Island.

Brave sellsword warriors [Mimb](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mimb.html>), [Ozimud](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/ozimud.html>) and _Gabrio_, joined by CI member *Gabriel Santiago* and led by a prominent MT official [Ogrodnik](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/ogrodnik.html>) formed a new faction.

They reached a peaceful agreement of lands gift from [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>), and established their capital in [Cerene Vale](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cerene_vale.html>) - their newly found homeland.

The founding statement from this new faction to the people of Zeithalt is:

> *Zeithalt is changing, under threat from unnatural disturbances and behavior. We must protect her and live in balance with nature to thrive long-term.*

## <a id="eon0367"></a>Eon 367 - The Fishy Battle of Imperial Swamp

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

Cybernetics Inc attacks the [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) and wins The Fishy Battle Of [Imperial Swamp](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/imperial_swamp.html>).

A notable achievement for Cybers - it is their first victory in a battle against factions, allowing them to repeat the MT’s record of holding 10 lands at the same time.

[MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) mostly stayed out of it, adhering to their new policy of peacekeeping, although some MT players in pursuit of gold and fame were active during the battle.

## <a id="eon0359"></a>Eon 359 - The Battle of Corrupted Forest

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) (combined faction forces)

[A’as Forest](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/aas_forest.html>) is successfully defended by the combined forces of three factions.

Honorable mention - MTs battle commander [Revalx](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/revalx.html>), for doing impressive work in organising the people of all factions.

Other notable events include:
- Record low participation from [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>);
- MindTech Institute not using their [Garrisons](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/garrisons.html>) nor [Corrupted Mines](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_mines.html>) to help the defence;
- it’s a _very_ close call again, the outcome of the battle decided in the very last moments.

Reports say that [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and  were able to gather enough corrupted matter and complete (separately) their own [CR Research](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_artefacts.html>) projects.

## <a id="eon0353"></a>Eon 353 - Corruption research in full swing

`⌛ Event`

Predictions about [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) targets are no longer based on rumours and prophecies.

Due to ongoing peace, factions have set up an extensive network of control stations and research facilities all over the island.

Based on the observations done by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) scientists, it is reported that the first signs of approaching [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) are appearing in [A’as Forest](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/aas_forest.html>).
## <a id="eon0352"></a>Eon 352 - DC calls off an attack

`⌛ Event`

After two other factions skipped their turns in hopes to preserve peace, [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) decided to join this effort and too will not attack at this time.

`⌛ Event`

⏳ The [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) passes their attack turn with the following message:

> The Institute's Minds welcome this idea of the Cybernetics brothers and answer to the call for peace in similar manner.
> 
> We wish to not participate in combat during this cycle and pass out turn as well. Instead, we use this time to help the restoration works of the damaged circuits in the Cybertron Jungle and to further improve and evolve our own lands and minds alike.
> 
> Let the island of Zeithalt enter a new era, let it prosper in peace and harmony!


## <a id="eon0347"></a>Eon 347 - CI calls for peace

`⌛ Event`

Still working on repairs and seeing so much destruction around them from the recent corruption strike, [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) made a call for the idea of peace within the Island. 

CI have taken that first step themselves and chose not to engage in a new battle.
## <a id="eon0345"></a>Eon 345 - The Battle of Corrupted Jungle

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) (combined faction forces)

In this very close battle after several hours of fighting everyone was on edge till the very last minute. Though great cooperation the factions have once again defeated the [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) threat.

It is believed, however, that some [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) have intentionally not participated in the hope that [Cybertron Jungle](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybertron_jungle.html>) would fall. It’s just a suspicion, but this idea can be poisonous for future politics on the island.

During the battle [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) members were able to gather enough corrupted matter to synthesize [Corrupted Mines](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_mines.html>) - powerful defensive weapon, first of its kind on Zeithalt.

## <a id="eon0339"></a>Eon 339 - CR Outburst is predicted to happen in Cybertron

`⌛ Event`

The preachers across Zeithalt once again speak of the dangers [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) brings to the Island… this time [Cybertron Jungle](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybertron_jungle.html>) is said to be affected.
## <a id="eon0338"></a>Eon 338 - The 3rd Battle of Mt. Pickles

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

The [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and MindTech Institute alliance stands strong, bringing more benefits to the mind faction. Notably, [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) was able to put up the great fight, gathering more points than the [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>).

During this battle your fellow historian mostly slept and been busy with stuff, so this battle bears no special name. It’s just known as The 3rd Battle of Mt. Pickles.

Two times in a row [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) help the Minds win new lands from [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>)… which brings us to the question - what’s in it for Cybernetics Inc?

With the upcoming [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) battle, we will see if the factions are able to unite under new circumstances or if the political quarrels mean more to them than the fate of the Zeithalt Island…

## <a id="eon0330"></a>Eon 330 - The Confusing Battle of Indigo Shore

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

The most notable events are [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) joining forces with MindTech Institute to attack [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) after a long period of 6 battle when DC and CI where united. 

Quite confusing for DC who were quick to call it a betrayal.

Also, in the epic meme moment [Loki](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/loki.html>) got confused and defended in the middle of his faction’s attack. This brought massive embarrassment to him as he was also a King of the Server at the time and everyone paid attention to his actions.

All this confusion granted the battle its name - The Confusing Battle of [Indigo Shore](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/indigo_shore.html>).

## <a id="eon0314"></a>Eon 314 - The Battle of Corrupted Desert

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) (combined faction forces)

The factions were able to put aside their quarrels and differences to fight off the greater threat. 

Defense is successful and [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>) stays under MindTech Institute's control.

[HexAgon](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/hexagon.html>), MT leader at the time and the greatest warrior of this battle, finds a unique artifact - [Corrupted gemstone](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_gemstone.html>).

## <a id="eon0310"></a>Eon 310 - Unknown treat appears on the Island

`⌛ Event`

Rumors of unknown threat start spreading across Zeithalt Island.

[MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) attacks [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>), however the battle ends early as the Minds realise that they cannot win this battle.

All sides of the conflict just agree to cut it short it and give the victory to Delta Collective, who keep their lands.

Due to this unusual even the battle is known as The Boring Battle.

## <a id="eon0280"></a>Eon 280 - Battle of Brickland Fortress

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

Having won all previous battles, [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) is now believed the most powerful faction on the Island. They attack [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)'s [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>) hoping to catch DC in their weakest moment.

However, the influx of new warriors in Delta Collective and their ability to negotiate an alliance with [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) despite recent Deltan attack helps to change the tides and win the battle.

![Battle Map](https://zeithalt.github.io/t/m/eon0280.png)


## <a id="eon0275"></a>Eon 275 - Uprising in the Delta Collective

`⌛ Event`

A bunch of people team up to seize control of the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>).

The faction starts speaking [Deltan language](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltan_language.html>) instead of the [Common language](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/common_language.html>) spoken universally by the whole Zeithalt. 

[GreenOtter](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/greenotter.html>) is deposed from being a leader of Delta Collective and is exiled from the faction.

## <a id="eon0273"></a>Eon 273 - Technological advancement

In retribution for previous MT actions, the [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) attack [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>) and almost win the battle.

It all comes down to the very last minutes of the battle, and could've ended either way, but in the end the [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>) prevail and narrowly avoid losing their sacred land. 

![Battle Map](https://zeithalt.github.io/t/m/eon0266.png)


## <a id="eon0266"></a>Eon 266 - Battle of Dev Null Marsh

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

This battle starts as a [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) attack on [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)'s [Dev Null Marsh](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/dev_null_marsh.html>). 

Unexpectedly the MindTech Institute joins the attack, which causes confusion in both Cybers ranks and the Institute itself.

During the battle Minds temporarily start helping Cybers defense, but eventually switch back to the attack and win the battle.

This battle is the starting point of the mutual hatred between Cybers and Minds, that would last for hundreds of Eons to come.
