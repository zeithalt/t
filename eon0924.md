## [Eon 924](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0924>) - Explosive Battle of Brickland Fortress

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

While Deltans were still recovering after the previous devastating loss, nobody expected any surprises from this battle. 

The Deltans, however, managed to surprise everyone by launching a sudden attack on the [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>) - a stronghold of the [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>).

At first, the battle played out more or less as expected, with the Deltans slowly but surely creeping their way though the initial advantage of the Silvan defenders.

However, the last third of the battle saw a remarkable turn of events as the heavy use of bombs and artillery began on both sides.

In the unprecedented shelling of the positions, the Deltans managed to break through the Silvan defenses and capture the fortress.

In this battle, every little detail mattered and up until the very last minute it wasn't clear who would prevail.
