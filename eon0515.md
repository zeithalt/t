## [Eon 515](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0515>) - The Sleepy Siege of Cerene Vale

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>)

It was quite an uneventful battle where [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) were prepared and [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) clearly did a bad job planning out this battle.

[Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) stayed neutral, while [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) quickly realised that mistakes were made and that the battle cannot be won.

The slow and frankly quite boring nature of this unsuccessful siege has granted the battle its name - _The Sleepy Siege of Cerene Vale_.
