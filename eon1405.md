## [Eon 1405](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1405>) - Methodical Cleanup of Xyrclaox Watch

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) (combined faction forces)

After the recent slip-ups with corruption in the [Webified](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1389>) and [Ares](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1396>) regions, the factions took a more careful and measured approach to the [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) cleanup.

The defense area of [Xyrclaox Watch](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/xyrclaox_watch.html>) was divided into sectors, responsibilities were assigned, and the factions took slow, methodical steps to clear the land of _Corruption_.

Over the long night, the _Corruption_ managed to take some ground back; however, night watches and patrols were posted to contain the threat until morning reinforcements arrived.

Due to this careful and thoughtful approach, the actual execution looked almost easy in comparison to previous battles.

The _Corruption_ still remains a dangerous threat, but with this new strategy, the factions have begun their steady progress toward lifting the [State of Emergency](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/boz_state_of_emergency.html>).
