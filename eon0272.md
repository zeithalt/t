## [Eon 272](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0272>) - The 2nd Battle of Timeless Desert

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

In retribution for previous MT actions, the [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) attack [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>) and almost win the battle.

It all comes down to the very last minutes of the battle, and could've ended either way, but in the end the [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>) prevail and narrowly avoid losing their sacred land.
