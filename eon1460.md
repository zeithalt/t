## [Eon 1460](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1460>) - Unification of Timeless Desert

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>)

Even though this battle was initially presented as yet another anti-[Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) effort, it was later revealed to be a move to consolidate Cloudy Operatives' control over the [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>).

Ever since the [Deltan destruction and plunder](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1320>) of the Desert and the subsequent [recapture by allied forces](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1374>), allied troops have remained in the region to ensure its stability.

With this latest development, the allied factions withdrew their forces, allowing full control of the Desert to be restored.

This did not happen without complications. The Deltans launched a solid counter-effort in the southern regions, and _Corruption_ was unleashed when its hotspots were disturbed.

However, despite all the adversities, the Desert has once again been firmly taken under the sole control of the Operatives.
