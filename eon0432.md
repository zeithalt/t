`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) (combined faction forces)

In this battle factions once again stood strong against the [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>), winning with quite a margin.

However, this battles was not without surprises - [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) forces were considerable more powerful than other factions, while [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) performance was so underwhelming, that [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) was the second best.
