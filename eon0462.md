## [Eon 462](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0462>) - The 2nd Siege of Neuropolis

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

Quite surprisingly, in this battle [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) - known for their chaotic and warring spirit - seemingly decided to follow [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) steps, as both these faction stayed neutral.

[Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) defending effort was good, but well outmatched by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) attacking power.

Important thing to note is that during this battle the deal between [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) and [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>) to trade [Paradox Pass](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/paradox_pass.html>) (becomes CI land) for [Illusion Cliffs](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/illusion_cliffs.html>) (goes to MT) was uncovered, raising more questions from other factions.
