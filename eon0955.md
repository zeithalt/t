## [Eon 955](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0955>) - Frustrating Battle of Mt. Pickles

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>)

Of course, frustration is a part of any battle, but this battle for [Mt.Pickles](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mt_pickles.html>) was particularly frustrating for [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) as they saw the complete turnaround of their former ally [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>).

This battle marked a potential end of Minds' neutrality policy, with them clearly favouring Protectores Silva in this battle.

Even though the Deltans were able to put up an impressive fight to retake (formerly) their land, the combined forces of all other factions were able to confidently defend it.
