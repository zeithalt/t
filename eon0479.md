## [Eon 479](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0479>) - The Crawling Battle of Xyrclaox Watch

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

[The Watch’s](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/xyrclaox_watch.html>) defenses prepared by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) are good and attackers have to come from a narrow path to the lands… This offensive was never going to be easy.

With [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) and [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) staying near perfectly neutral, this battle dragged on even more…

Since the beginning of the battle, [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) slowly but surely were closing the gap between them and the [Mind](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>), until in a final push they were able to secure the victory.

The careful, slow and intense nature of the battle has granted it its name - _The Crawling Battle of [Xyrclaox Watch](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/xyrclaox_watch.html>)_.
