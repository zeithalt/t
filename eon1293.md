## [Eon 1293](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1293>) - The 3rd Defense of Webified Hills

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) (combined faction forces)

The [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) returned, to the [Webified Hills](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/webified_hills.html>), stronger than ever.

Following the recent [Masterful Defence](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1200>), all strategic plans were already in place and executed with near perfection once again.

It's worth noting that the [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) made up the majority of the fighting force on site, far outnumbering the region's actual owners - [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) - and providing crucial support.

In the later hours of the battle, the defenders experienced a shortage of manpower. However, under the joint supervision of the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) and the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>), the fight against the _Corruption_ was won once more.
