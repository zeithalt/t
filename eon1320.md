## [Eon 1320](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1320>) - The Fall of Timeless Desert

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

[Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>), which had stood strong for 1,068 eons of Zeithalt’s recorded history, has finally fallen.

The unexpected assault by Deltan forces marked a turning point - this was the first time the [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>) had been attacked since their founding.

Caught between the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) to the south and the [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) to the north, the defenders suffered heavy losses and were forced to retreat early.

In a last-ditch effort, they poured every resource into a counteroffensive - emptying the faction’s treasury and deploying all available forces - but it was not enough to stop the Deltan advance.

The Fall of the Desert marked the end of an era, as the Deltans sealed the fate of the island’s old way of life.

The immediate aftermath was devastating: the [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>) were all but annihilated, their faction put on the brink of extinction.

The Valkyrie Spec Ops - once the core of the [Fighters Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>) based in [The Nest](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/the_nest.html>) - lost their headquarters and were disbanded.

Even in [Admincity](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/admincity.html>), the shock waves triggered political chaos: the dictator [NAIRO](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/nairo.html>) fled the capital, and the [Cybernetic Imperium](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1221>) appeared to be collapsing.

As dust and ash settle over the desert ruins, one question remains - was this the culmination of the Deltan war, or only the beginning of their world domination?
