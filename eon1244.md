## [Eon 1244](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1244>) - Loss of Blue Screen Lagoon

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>)

As the major events of the _War on MindTech_ unfold, another part of the plan is put into action.

The [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) forces, in a coordinated effort with the [Cybernetic Imperium](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1221>), launch an attack on the [Blue Screen Lagoon](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/blue_screen_lagoon.html>) in a battle known as _Loss of Blue Screen Lagoon_.

It is believed that the attack was a part of the plan to take over the [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) and its assets, as well as to secure a foothold in the region.

The former _Cybers'_ capital served as a launch point for the attack, and the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) forces were able to quickly overwhelm the defenders.

Despite a solid pushback from the defenders at the end of the battle, all they managed to do is to secure some parts of the Blue Screen - Paradox Pass border. However, a small portion of it still remained under the control of the _Brothers_ with a potential for future in-land attacks.
