## [Eon 1365](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1365>) - Backfired Battle of Brickland Fortress

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

In the lead-up to this battle, the [Protectores Silva's](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) plan seemed simple: attack the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) while they were still distracted by a recent [Corruption outbreak](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1354>).

The attack landed as a heavy blow on [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>)... however the battle did not go as planned.

Instead of quickly plowing through _Deltan_ defenses, the _Silvan_ attack first bogged down, then ground to a halt.

A few hours into the battle, the _Silvans_ and their allies began losing ground to a counter-advancing Deltan army.

The result was that the _Silvan_ forces were pushed entirely out of _Brickland Fortress_, solidifying the _Deltan_ hold on the region for the foreseeable future.
