## [Eon 338](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0338>) - The 3rd Battle of Mt. Pickles

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

The [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and MindTech Institute alliance stands strong, bringing more benefits to the mind faction. Notably, [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) was able to put up the great fight, gathering more points than the [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>).

During this battle your fellow historian mostly slept and been busy with stuff, so this battle bears no special name. It’s just known as The 3rd Battle of Mt. Pickles.

Two times in a row [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) help the Minds win new lands from [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>)… which brings us to the question - what’s in it for Cybernetics Inc?

With the upcoming [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) battle, we will see if the factions are able to unite under new circumstances or if the political quarrels mean more to them than the fate of the Zeithalt Island…
