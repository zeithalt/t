## [Eon 1209](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1209>) - A Dumb Battle of Cerene Vale

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

This [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) attack on [Cerene Vale](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cerene_vale.html>) was a complete disaster. 

The attacking forces were not prepared for the strong defense of [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) and the battle was effectively lost in a matter of hours.

Two tall [Silvan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) giants stood above others - Nex and BPS, crushing all hopes and efforts of the _Deltan_ attackers. 

The almost unanimous opinion of the foolish nature of this attack has granted the battle its name - _A Dumb Battle of Cerene Vale_.
