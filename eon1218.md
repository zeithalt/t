## [Eon 1218](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1218>) - Toothless Battle of Chaotic Plains

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

In a retaliation attempt, [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) attacked [Chaotic Plains](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/chaotic_plains.html>) but failed to capture the region from [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>).

The battle was eerily similar to the [recent deltan attack](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1209>) - a short burst of fighting at the beginning of a battle, followed by a long period of positional movement without much action.

This battle is known as _Toothless Battle of Chaotic Plains_ due to the fact that [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) were not able to inflict any noticeable damage on the [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) and were forced to retreat.
