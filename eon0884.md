## [Eon 884](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0884>) - The Rise of Admincity

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

It's unknown what happened behind the scenes in this battle, but seemingly everyone has turned on [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) that evening. 

Even their allies, the [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>) - the very same army who took the city some 40 eons prior and ceded it to Deltans, were now seen among the attacking forces.

The attacking army was massive and overwhelming. They were able to surround the city and breach the gates with the help from locals who happily greeted them on the streets. 

Instead of a planned long siege, the attackers were able to take the city in a matter of hours, sending Deltan forces on the run.

The citizens of Admincity celebrate on the streets, but the tensions on the island are only growing: it's unclear what the new [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) stance is, and the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) still has the biggest army that could regroup and strike back at any time.
