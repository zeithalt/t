## Eon 451 - The Blitz Battle of Peace Death Gorge

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html)

[Delta Collective](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html) gather considerable power of own men and hired sellswords to organize a successful blitz attack on [Peace Death Gorge](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html), reclaiming this land back under control.

Both [Cybernetics Inc](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html) (defending side) and [Protectores Silva](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html) (staying neutral, as usual) keep very low profiles, having almost no effect on the outcome of the battle.

[MindTech Institute](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html) quite unexpectedly joins the offensive. It’s unclear if their intervention was an effort to help the [Deltans](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html), or an attempt of hijacking their attack. Either way, [Minds](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html) power was not enough to contest the confident win by [Delta Collective](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html).
