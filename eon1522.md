## [Eon 1522](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1522>) - Hard Siege of Cerene Vale

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>)

Despite having about the same impact on the map as [the previous battle](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1209>) in [Cerene Vale](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cerene_vale.html>), this battle proved to be very different.

The combined [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) and [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) forces came prepared and launched the biggest offensive seen in hundreds of eons, perhaps ever.

Record-breaking Deltan numbers on the battlefield were met by even larger forces on the defending side.

[Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>), joined by very strong support from [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) and [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>), stood strong on the battlefield, pulling off an immense effort to firmly hold their capital against the enemy.

One interesting point was the almost complete absence of [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>), who took a neutral stance in this battle, deciding not to participate in the defence of their longest ally's capital.
