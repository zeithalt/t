## [Eon 810](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0810>) - Grinding Battle of Peace Death Gorge

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

In this battle, factions (especially Deltans) fought for every inch of the land in the [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>) to reclaim it.

The Delta Collective had done a lot of preparations and had a lot of experience in the area, so they were able to get the early lean which only grew as the battle moved forward.

In fact, the force with which the Deltans fought here made the other factions' efforts pale in comparison - the Delta Collective is estimated to have gathered a bigger army than all four other factions _combined_.

Such an immense force was not only able to secure this land, but also made the people across the Island talk about the current balance of power and its meaning for future battles.
