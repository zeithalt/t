## Eon 706 - The Fall of Ares Garden

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html)

_Delta Collective_ attacks [Protectores Silva](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html) to seize control over the [Ares Gardens](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/ares_gardens.html) in a battle known as _The Fall of Ares Garden_.

This battle has two remarkable traits:
- it’s the first ever direct attack by any faction on _Protectores Silva_;
- it’s the first appearance of [Fighters Guild](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html) in a cross-factional battle.

[Sellswords](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/sellswords.html) in this battle dealt more damage than both [Cybernetics Inc](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html) or [MindTech Institute](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html), clearly establishing a new powerful player on the Zeithalt map.

However, their efforts were not enough to help _Silvans_ win this battle.
