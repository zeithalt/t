## [Eon 1374](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1374>) - Colorful Battle Of Timeless Desert

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>)

This battle was believed to be the _Operatives'_ last chance for survival: either they reclaimed their sacred [Timeless Desert](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html>) or they would be eliminated, ceasing to exist as a faction.

Employing the military might of _Cybernetics Inc_ and backed by the _MindTech Institute's_ strategic planning, the _Operatives_ launched a daring - some would even say suicidal - attempt to free _The Desert_ from [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) occupation.

From the get-go, the battle proved difficult. Early plans fell through as the defenses set up by the _Deltans_ were far more robust than anticipated.

Cleverly switching tactics, the attackers moved back and forth between assaulting the enemy and patching holes in their own lines, managing to persevere through the long and gritty battle.

A crucial moment came when severe infighting broke out between the _Cybers_ and the _Operatives_ in the north of the region. The friendly fire was brought under control only after several hours of confusion and unnecessary losses.

At points, it seemed everyone was fighting everyone else. With banners of all sorts flying across the battlefield, a _MindTech_ scholar, _J. Makintaer_, was prompted to nickname the conflict the _Colorful Battle of Timeless Desert_.

As a result, the _Desert_ itself now looks quite colorful on the map. All four factions of the anti-Deltan alliance are represented, with only half of the region under the direct control of the _Cloudy Operatives_.

This leaves open the question of how exactly this new reality will shape the future politics of Zeithalt.
