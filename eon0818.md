## [Eon 818](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0818>) - Blitz Battle of the A'as Forest

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

It was a quick and decisive battle in here the attacking MindTech forces were ahead of their opposition by a colossal margin.

First of all, Minds prepared greatly for this battle, and attacked [A'as Forest](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/aas_forest.html>) from three sides simultaneously, almost trapping the opposing [Silvan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) and [Cybernetics'](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) troops in the process.

Secondly, _Minds_ were able to secure contracts with both [Fighters' Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>) and [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>) to further increase their numbers.

Lastly, [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) - who are currently considered to have the strongest army on the Island - once again proved to be a reliable ally and provided them with the necessary support.

As a result, the battle was decided in a matter of hours - the attackers had vastly superior force, and the battle was finished quickly.
