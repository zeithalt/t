## [Eon 759](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0759>) - The Festive Battle on the Marshes

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

During the holidays celebrated across the Island, but not in the Deltan lands, the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) launch enormous and unexpected attack on [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) in [Dev Null Marsh](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/dev_null_marsh.html>).

The [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) are caught completely off guard. 

Their defences in the region are crippled by the very first strike, and even their allies [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) - being worn down and demoralized by [their own recent losses](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0749>) -  are unable to gather an army to come to the aid.

As the result, [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) glide through this battle with almost no resistance and reclaim the land that once belonged to them.

The second-best army on the battlefield was surprisingly the [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>), who were able to put up a good effort towards DC victory, despite [the turbulent times their faction goes through](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0755>).

The fact that this battle happened during the holiday season granted it a special name - _The Festive Battle on the Marshes_.
