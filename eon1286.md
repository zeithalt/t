## [Eon 1286](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1286>) - Fierce Defense of Paradox Pass

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

The [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) and [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) alliance pushed further east to attack the central land of the [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) - [Paradox Pass](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/paradox_pass.html>).

This region hadn't seen a major battle in a long time - [for 884 eons](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0402>), in fact - and had been considered the peaceful heartland of the Institute.

It was widely assumed that by this stage of the war, the Institute was on the verge of collapse and wouldn’t mount much of a defense.

However, the defenders launched a highly effective and surprising special operation, outsmarting the attackers and gaining an early advantage in the battle.

Such a strong defense was unexpected, and the attackers were forced to regroup to prevent their frontline from collapsing.

The offensive shifted from a blitz to an endurance battle. While the defenders held their ground impressively, they were ultimately overwhelmed by the attackers' superior numbers.

Time will tell whether this was the Institute's final spark of resistance - or the beginning of a strategic resurgence that could shift the course of the war.
