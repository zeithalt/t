## [Eon 1221](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1221>) - NAIRO Declares Cybernetics Imperium

`âŒ› Event`

In an unexpected turn of events, [NAIRO](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/nairo.html>) declares the formation of the _Cybernetics Imperium_ and crowns himself as its Emperor. 

This move received mixed reactions from the community, with some factions supporting the idea of a unified cybernetic empire, while others expressed concerns about the potential for tyranny and oppression.

[MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) claiming to receive direct threats from [NAIRO](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/nairo.html>) and his followers, dubbed the new government as "Headless Empire" due to the fact that _Cybers_ capital [Admincity](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/admincity.html>) is still under control of [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>).

At the same time, the [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) factions congratulated [NAIRO](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/nairo.html>) on his new title, and generally welcomed this change of direction.

Other factions, namely [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) and [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>) took a rather cautious stance on the matter, not issuing any statements or comments on the new government. 

It remains to be seen how this new development will affect the balance of power in the region and whether _NAIRO's_ Imperium will live up to its name.
