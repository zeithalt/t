## [Eon 1530](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1530>) - Final Clean-Up of Webified Hills

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

_Cybernetics Inc_ performed the final push against [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) in [Webified Hills](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/webified_hills.html>), clearing the very last corrupted land on the Island.

The clean-up was methodical and careful, as has become the norm lately; however, the lack of support from some factions was noted in Admincity.

The Island looks remarkably clean and free of _Corruption_ ahead of a new [Corruption Outburst](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_fallout.html>) predicted to start soon in [Ares Gardens](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/ares_gardens.html>).
