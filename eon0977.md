## [Eon 977](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0977>) - Anti-CR Training in the Blue Screen Lagoon

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

For the first time ever [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>) do not pass on the attacking opportunity and for a good reason. 

This military exercise serves as a way for factions to gather up new recruits after many have been lost in the recent [Corruption Outburst in the Illusion Cliffs](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0969>).

This battle also gave start to the [Restoration Project](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_restoration_project.html>) - many of those participating in the battle were swiftly redeployed to the affected areas to help with the recovery efforts.

However, this battle did not escape it's own share of controversy as the [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) were reportedly accused by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) of conspiring to set up an actual attack on their land during the training.

In the end, it seems, the differences were settled (or have never been there) and the battle was fought as planned.
