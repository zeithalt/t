## [Eon 1176](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1176>) - The Burning of Admincity

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>)


The 2nd Siege of [Admincity](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/admincity.html>) might become the pivotal battle in the ongoing war, as the formidable [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>), alongside the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>), launched an audacious assault on the CI capital.

Despite expectations of a brutal defense, CI’s resistance was surprisingly weaker than anticipated. 

The defenders struggled to coordinate their forces, and key CI commanders were absent from the battlefield, leaving the city vulnerable to the meticulously planned amphibious landing by BB and DC. 

The attacking forces executed their assault with near-perfect precision, securing a dominant position early on and maintaining control for the majority of the battle.

A key moment in the battle was the reappearance of Nex, the legendary Protectores Silva juggernaut, whose presence alone was said to be equal to a dozen soldiers. 

However, even his immense strength was not enough to turn the tide against the steady and overwhelming advance of Deltan factions.

With little effective resistance, the attackers stormed the city, plundering and razing key structures. The fall of Admincity was more than a military loss for Cybers — it was a symbolic shift in power. 

Is this the beginning of a new empire, a show of strength before eventual peace talks, or yet another sad page in the never-ending conflict?
