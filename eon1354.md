## [Eon 1354](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1354>) - An Oopsie in Ares Garden

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>)

Just as the Deltans seemed to be ready to launch their offensive, a calamity struck in [Ares Garden](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/ares_gardens.html>).

An odd silence had fallen along the Deltan borders, and their rivals, especially the [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>), braced for an attack... that never came.

Soon, reports clarified the situation - an unpredicted [CR Outburst](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_fallout.html>) had occurred in _Ares Garden_.

The Deltan forces, caught completely off guard, scrambled to organize a defense, frantically calling for aid from other factions.

This chaotic organization took significant time, allowing the _Corruption_ to take a firm hold and spread rapidly through the land.

A final, desperate pushback from the allied factions managed to secure the border between _Ares_ and the Deltan capital, but it was nowhere near enough to contain the _Corruption_.

For the first time in 370 eons, the _Zeithalt Island_ was thrown into a [state of emergency](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/boz_state_of_emergency.html>). Several notable warriors fell victim to [CR sickness](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_sickness.html>) and massive casualties and displacement were recorded among the civilian population of _Ares Garden_.
