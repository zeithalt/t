## [Eon 965](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0965>) - BB establish a capital in the Imperial Swamp

`âŒ› Event`

A recent exchange with [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) leads to [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) establishing a capital in the [Imperial Swamp](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/imperial_swamp.html>).

After an unsuccessful attempt in [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>), the young faction is attempting a new start in a completely different location on the map.

The political situation in this new region is different, but with new opportunities also come new challenges.

It remains to be seen how the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) will fare in their new home.
