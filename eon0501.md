## [Eon 501](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0501>) - The Failed Landing near Virtuara Outpost

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

Attack by sea and at an unusual time - [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) clearly hoped for a swift and surprising attack…

However, [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) were prepared for that: defences were ready, troops anticipated the attack.

Notable that in this battle [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) broke their long-time habit of being neutral and sided with [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) in this battle.

[MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) stayed neutral, making it a 1 vs 2 attack, with no land support.

As a result, [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) successfully fends off the [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) threat and wins _The Failed Landing near Virtuara Outpost_.
