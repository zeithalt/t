## [Eon 666](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0666>) - The Spooky Battle of Chaotic Plains

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) (combined faction forces)

[Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) strikes [Chaotic Plains](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/chaotic_plains.html>) causing a _Spooky Battle of Chaotic Plains_, which, however was closely won by collective factions’ effort.

_Zeithalt historian took a break during this time, so there’s little or no written history of this event._
