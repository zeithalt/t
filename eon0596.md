## Eon 596 - The Fall of Imperial Swamp

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Corruption](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html)

Some say after previous easy victory over _Corruption_ the factions became too reckless. Others say heavy suppression of the _Corruption_ last time caused it being overcharged this time, resulting in uncontrollable violent outburst…

Either way, the collective effort of factions wasn’t enough and [Imperial Swamp](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/imperial_swamp.html) falls - the land is currently uninhabitable and man-made structures, such as [Altar of Ctulhu](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/altar_of_ctulhu.html) and [Money Factory](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/money_factory.html), are destroyed.

[Bank of Zeithalt](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/bank_of_zeithalt.html) has declared the Island-wide state of emergency until the necessary [CR Restoration Project](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_restoration_project.html) stages are completed to contain the threat.
