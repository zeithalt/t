## Eon 540 - Restoration of Oblivion Mire

`⌛ Event`

Peaceful collaboration between factions made response to corruption swift and timely - [Restoration Project](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_restoration_project.html) is completed in [Oblivion Mire](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/oblivion_mire.html).

While these lands will forever remain scarred by the disaster and every man-made structure was destroyed while the event unfolded, _Oblivion_ now stands clear from [Corruption](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html).

Since all population was evacuated previously from _Oblivion Mire_, it is currently a free land, not belonging to any faction.

The immediate danger is gone, but Zeithalt will remember _The Dark Night on the Mire_ and the lessons it taught us.
