## [Eon 1468](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1468>) - Reconquering of Ares Garden

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

[Ares Garden](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/ares_gardens.html>) - the land from which the [longest State of Emergency began](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1354>) following a mistake by [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) leadership - has now been targeted to finally bring it to an end.

There were reports before the battle that, in anticipation of a long and difficult clean-up, the Deltans had been conserving their resources during previous battles.

One peculiar incident involved the [Fighters Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>) landing on the narrow Shore of Ares. They tried to capture the coast and enforce a naval blockade of the region, claiming to be acting on a private mission funded by an unknown customer.

Even though some _Fighters'_ forces remained on the shore, this blockade failed, as most of it was recaptured by the Deltans.

Through a collective effort, with the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) at the helm and the _Delta Collective_ following closely behind, the factions once again emerged victorious over the unnatural and unforgiving _Corruption_.

Ares Garden has been fully cleaned up and reconquered, putting an end to the record-breaking, 116-eon State of Emergency.
