## [Eon 391](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0391>) - 2nd Battle of Corrupted Desert

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) (combined faction forces)

The participation was high and battle ended rather quickly.

Due to various factors and the recent spike in activity and commitment, this battle against the [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) was less intense than the last one and many think it was won much easier this time.

Does it mean that the next time the [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) will strike harder?
