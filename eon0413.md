## [Eon 413](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0413>) - The Battle of Legoland Fortress

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

This battle is dubbed “of Legoland Fortress” my some MT members because after two failed attempts, on the third try the [fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>) finally crumbled.

This battle questionably marks the end of [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) partnership, as [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) are left unsatisfied by [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) underwhelming participation in battle.

On the other hand, only a fraction of Cybers supported MT in this battle, what probably left [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>) unimpressed too.

The tensions are rising, alliances are shaking. It seems only [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) manages to not worsen it’s position in this battle, by keeping low profile - a position, understandable for a small and so far a peaceful faction.
