## [Eon 526](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0526>) - The Recapture of Synaxos Fields

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

This was quite an unusual battle - for the first time in more than 270 eons that passed since the end of [Age of Conquest](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/age_of_conquest.html>), all faction fought capture a free land.

[Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) and [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) did not provide a remarkable presence on the battlefield, while [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) saw this battle as an extension of clearing out the [Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>) of the [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) and provided much more noticeable support.

[MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) had by far the most power in this battle, successfully completing _The Recapture Of Synaxos Fields_.
