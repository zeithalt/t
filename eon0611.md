## Eon 611 - A Picnic near The Purple Deeps

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html)

As a late night settles in the _Deltan_ lands, joint forces of [Cybernetics Inc](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html) and [Protectores Silva](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html) lay a siege to the Deltan capital of [Purple Deeps](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/purple_deeps.html).

Interestingly, most _Deltan_ forces were absent or asleep at that time, so their allies from [MindTech Institute](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html) had to fend off the first attacks.

In the initial hours heavy fighting breaks out, almost bringing down Deeps’ defences to an equal fight, but in an unexplainable turn of events the fighting stops in its tracks and all factions take a break for several hours.

This sudden break granted the battle its name - _A Picnic near The Purple Deeps_.

Later on, the battle resumes, but by that time full power of _Deltan_ forces were awake, joined by increased numbers of the [Minds](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html)… as a result, defenders had a comfortable lead till the very end of the battle.
