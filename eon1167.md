## [Eon 1167](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1167>) - The Strained Defense of Peace Death Gorge

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) (combined faction forces)


The battle of [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>) saw yet another vicious assault by [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>), threatening to consume one of the most contested regions in history. 

Despite their history of dominance in the region, [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) struggled due to the **notable absence of Cybernetics Inc (CI)**, which chose to abstain from aiding in the battle. Many suspect this reluctance was due to growing fears over DC’s expanding influence and its increasing control over critical territories. 

Meanwhile, [Protectores Silva (PS)](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) offered only minor reinforcements, as their famed leader **Nex** was missing from the battlefield, leading to a weaker-than-expected response from their faction.

As the battle raged on, a rising controversy took shape. 

Some factions voiced concerns about the emerging habit of weaponizing Corruption as a tactical tool or a political lever cross-factional conflicts.

While DC successfully held their ground, the lack of collective factional unity raised questions about the true balance of power on Zeithalt.

It seems that with each passing conflict, Deltan might continues to grow, leaving their opponents wary. 

How long before the Deltan army aims at even bigger goals? 

And when that day comes, will CI and PS regret standing idle at the Peace Death Gorge?
