## [Eon 563](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0563>) - The 5th Battle of Mt. Pickles

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

[Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) launches an invasion in [Mt. Pickles](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mt_pickles.html>) region - a land that has been peaceful for many eons, but forces of [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) are able to stop the _Deltan_ army in its tracks.

[MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) stayed neutral in the first half of the battle, but later joined the full-scale attack on [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>).

This is the first battle on record where both sides of the conflict launched special operations to undermine each other and get tactical advantage in the battle.

Remarkable trivia - _Mt. Pickles_ has now seen more battles than any other region on Zeithalt, but the previous battle happened here almost 200 eons ago.
