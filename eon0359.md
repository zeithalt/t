## [Eon 359](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0359>) - The Battle of Corrupted Forest

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) (combined faction forces)

[A’as Forest](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/aas_forest.html>) is successfully defended by the combined forces of three factions.

Honorable mention - MTs battle commander [Revalx](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/revalx.html>), for doing impressive work in organising the people of all factions.

Other notable events include:
- Record low participation from [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>);
- MindTech Institute not using their [Garrisons](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/garrisons.html>) nor [Corrupted Mines](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_mines.html>) to help the defence;
- it’s a _very_ close call again, the outcome of the battle decided in the very last moments.

Reports say that [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and  were able to gather enough corrupted matter and complete (separately) their own [CR Research](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_artefacts.html>) projects.
