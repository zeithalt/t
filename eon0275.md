## Eon 275 - Uprising in the Delta Collective

`⌛ Event`

A bunch of people team up to seize control of the [Delta Collective](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html).

The faction starts speaking [Deltan language](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltan_language.html) instead of the [Common language](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/common_language.html) spoken universally by the whole Zeithalt. 

[GreenOtter](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/greenotter.html) is deposed from being a leader of Delta Collective and is exiled from the faction.
