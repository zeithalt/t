## [Eon 1444](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1444>) - The Push Back at Webified Hills

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) (combined faction forces)

After careful battle planning, the combined faction force began its clean-up of the second-biggest [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) outpost: [Webified Hills](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/webified_hills.html>).

Overall, the battle had the same calm and collected "getting things done" atmosphere that most recent _Corruption_ clean-ups have had.

Despite the daunting task ahead, the factions slowly but steadily moved from tile to tile, cleaning up one patch of land after another.

Due to the large scope of the _Corruption Fallout_ in the region, the land was not fully cleared; however, the majority of it was secured, allowing _Cybernetics Inc_ to begin restoring control over the area.

One notable outcome of the battle was the surprisingly good performance of a couple of warriors who had recently departed from the [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) to join the _Cybers_.

With the recent passing of the former [Headmaster Dino Saurex](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/curious_dino.html>), does this mark a turn for the worse for the once-mighty faction?
