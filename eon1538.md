## [Eon 1538](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1538>) - Corruption Outburst in Ares Gardens

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) (combined faction forces)

The [Corruption Outburst](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_fallout.html>) occurred in [Ares Gardens](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/ares_gardens.html>) as predicted, and the factions stood ready.

The joint clean-up and containment operation was executed according to plan, without any significant hiccups.

[Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) also performed a simultaneous clean-up of a few remaining hot-spots in [Webified Hills](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/webified_hills.html>).

For the first time in 440 eons, the island stands completely free of [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>).
