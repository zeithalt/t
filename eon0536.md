## Eon 536 - The Dark Night on the Mire

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Corruption](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html)

[Oblivion Mire](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/oblivion_mire.html) is uninhabitable as factions fail to contain _Corruption_.

[Bank of Zeithalt](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/bank_of_zeithalt.html) reinstates its policies that were in order during the previous [Corruption Fallout](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_fallout.html) to minimize the damages to the Island’s economy.

Many people suffered exposure to _Corruption_ - luckily with recent developments we know that full recovery is possible, although it will take time to heal.

Most of [Oblivion Mire](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/oblivion_mire.html) is currently in uninhabitable state, many places just dangerous to be in due to _Corruption Fallout_.

As the last devastating news to the Islanders, renown [Valhalla Bar](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/valhalla_bar.html) is now also destroyed.

This night will be remembered as _The Dark Night on the Mire_.
