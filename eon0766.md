## [Eon 766](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0766>) - PS rebuilds capital in Cerene Vale

`âŒ› Event`

Following the [Burning of Cerene Vale](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0749>), the subsequent [changes](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0755>) in [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) and the [exchange of lands](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0761>), [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) begin rebuilding their capital in Cerene Vale.

With that, comes a logical conclusion of the MT-PS war.

The result of this war seems to be [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) losing a couple of their lands and having to rebuild their capital.

[Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>), lost Dev Null Marsh back to Deltans.

[MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) were able to reclaim one of their lands at a high cost of losing vast amounts of resources and ended up with a new government to navigate the political situation they put themselves in.

[Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) are the main benefactors of the war after reclaiming Ares Garden and squeezing out Silvans from the Imperial Swamp without major changes in their inner and outer politics.

But is it really the end of the war? Or is it just the beginning of a new chapter?
