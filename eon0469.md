## [Eon 469](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0469>) - The Corrupted Battle of PEBKAC Peak

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) (combined faction forces)

All major factions of Zeithalt once again were able to show great unity in fighting-off the [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) and pulled together a massive effort, narrowly winning against the ever-growing threat.

The eons leading up to the battle showed unprecedented collaborations between [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>). Factions temporarily traded lands and provided each other help in preparation for the  surge.

During the battle, [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) fought on par with [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>), while [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) were lagging a bit behind (though many attribute this to the battle starting at nighttime in Deltan time zone).

Due to the success in The Corrupted Battle of [PEBKAC Peak](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/pebkac_peak.html>) factions CR research projects move forward, giving more understanding on the nature of [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>).
