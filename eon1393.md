## [Eon 1393](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1393>) - BB transfers control over their lands in Paradox Pass to MT

`âŒ› Event`

The [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) transfers its portion of the [Paradox Pass](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/paradox_pass.html>) region to the [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>).

This exclave had been surrounded and difficult to defend ever since the _Brothers_ lost their conquests in [Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>) and [Neuropolis](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/neuropolis.html>).

Many believed it was only a matter of time until the _Brothers_ would be forced to give it up as well.

With this transition, Deltan forces are completely removed from sovereign MindTech lands, closing that grim chapter of _Minds_ history for good.
