`âŒ› Event`

In another feat of global cooperation, the factions are able to fast-track the lengthy and costly process of restoring the [Illusion Cliffs](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/illusion_cliffs.html>) region after the [Corruption Outburst](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_fallout.html>) of [Eon 969](./eon0969.html) and complete it in record time.

The region is now declared safe to inhabit again and the population is slowly returning to their homes.
