## [Eon 1139](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1139>) - The 4th Failed Siege of Purple Deeps

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) 

After a series of unsuccessful [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) attempts at reclaiming their lands, the retaliation from [Cyber](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>)-[Silvan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) alliance finally came.

The forces descended upon the [Purple Deeps](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/purple_deeps.html>), aiming to catch the Deltan capital off guard and overwhelm the defences.

The Deltans were prepared, however, and the battle was fierce. The Cybers and Silvans were able to surround the region from three sides, but the Deltans were able to hold their ground in the heart of the region and eventually push back.

Unprecedented cooperation by Deltans and Brothers made this victory possible. 

The Cybers and Silvans were forced to retreat, and the Deltans were able to hold their capital once again. 

This victory was a significant morale boost for the Deltans, whose victories became rare lately, the most recent being the [previous defence of their capital](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1052>) almost 100 eons ago.

However, now it falls to the Deltans to prove if they can turn the tide of this war and go on the offensive.
