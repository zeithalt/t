## [Eon 1023](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1023>) - The Explosive Battle of Chaotic Plains

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

This was yet another attempt by [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) to claim the region of [Chaotic Plains](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/chaotic_plains.html>).

The Silvans-Cybers alliance had to fight an uphill battle against the defenders, who had the advantage of the terrain and fortifications.

But the attackers came prepared too, and the events of the battle unfolded very quickly - this proved to be one of the fastest battles in the history of the Island.

Despite quick early gains by the attackers, Deltans were able to hold their ground and stop the advance in its tracks with heavy use of artillery.

The Silvan army was forced to abandon the attack and scatter for a quick retreat.

One of the few interesting political highlights is that [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) chose to join the defenders after a long period of neutrality.
