## [Eon 367](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0367>) - The Fishy Battle of Imperial Swamp

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

Cybernetics Inc attacks the [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) and wins The Fishy Battle Of [Imperial Swamp](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/imperial_swamp.html>).

A notable achievement for Cybers - it is their first victory in a battle against factions, allowing them to repeat the MT’s record of holding 10 lands at the same time.

[MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) mostly stayed out of it, adhering to their new policy of peacekeeping, although some MT players in pursuit of gold and fame were active during the battle.
