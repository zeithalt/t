## [Eon 1147](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1147>) - The Hard-earned Return of Peace Death Gorge

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

The battle-ridden region of [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>) was once again the stage for a fierce conflict between the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) and [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and their allies.

The Deltans, determined to take back the region, launched a massive assault on the Cybers' forces. The Cybers, however, were prepared for the attack and given the recent history - four successful defences behind their backs - they were confident in their ability to repel the Deltans.

However, the wave of euphoria that continues from Detans' recent [capital defense](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1139>) helps them to push through the Cybers' defenses and secure a decisive victory in the Peace Death Gorge.

The Cybers were forced to retreat, some of their forces scattered and lost in the chaos of the battle. 

The Deltans, on the other hand, were able to regroup and secure the region, marking a significant and long-deserved victory in their campaign.

In the aftermath of the battle, both sides are left to ponder their next moves. 

The Deltans are eager to capitalize on their recent successes, however, they're unsure if their riled up armies could keep up the pace. 

At the same time, the Cybers are taken aback by the sudden turn of events, and they're left to wonder if they can recover from these defeats to stop the Deltan advance.
