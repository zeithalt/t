## [Eon 1280](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1280>) - Deltans Strike Back in Brickland Fortress

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

After a rather meek effort by the [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) in their [previous attack](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1272>), it was apparent that the [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) would not pass up their chance to retaliate.

The two Deltan factions launched a joint attack on the [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>) in an effort to get close to the Silvan capital once again.

The defenders managed to organize a much stronger resistance than expected after their earlier failure. By some accounts, the armies showed roughly equal strength.

This made alliances even more crucial, and here [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) could have played a major role.

The Cybers struggled to maintain their friendly political stance toward both sides - Protectores Silva being their long-time ally, and Delta Collective a key supporter in the war against MindTech.

In the end, the Cybers assisted the Silvan defense, but either failed - or perhaps chose not - to gather a sizeable enough force to turn the tide of battle.

The result was a shaky Deltan victory. However, they managed to capture the southern part of the region and established a land connection to the Silvan capital.
