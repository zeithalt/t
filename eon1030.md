## [Eon 1030](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1030>) - Collaborative Battle at Dev Null Marsh

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) (combined faction forces)

Despite the recent chain of battles between DC/BoB on one side and Cybers/Silvans on the other - the factions have come together to face a common threat in the [Dev Null Marsh](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/dev_null_marsh.html>).

The defense was hard, but consistent and methodical work by the combined forces has managed to contain the threat and prevent it from spreading further.

This deep collaboration between factions has been a pleasant surprise to many, and it's expected that this might lead to a more stable period on the island.
