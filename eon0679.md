## Eon 679 - The Defense of Dev Null Marsh

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html)

[Delta Collective](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html) attacks [Dev Null Marsh](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/dev_null_marsh.html), starting a battle known as _Defense of Dev Null Marsh_.

It was practically won by a clever use of _Special Tactics_ and [resources](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/resources.html) by [Cybernetics Inc](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html).

_Zeithalt historian took a break during this time, so there’s little or no written history of this event._
