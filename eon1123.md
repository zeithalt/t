## [Eon 1123](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1123>) - Another Failed Landing Near Virtuara Outpost

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

[Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) launched a surprised attack on the [Virtuara Outpost](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/virtuara_outpost.html>).

While it was pretty obvious that deltan attacks would continue, the location for it was a surprise. The outpost was not heavily fortified, but it was well defended by the Cybers.

The Brothers were able to land a sizeable force on the ground, but they were quickly pushed back by the Cybers.

A special support team was dedicated to restrain the [Silvan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) jaggernaut Nex, which turned out to be a successful strategy on its own. However, the very same forces were dearly missed in the main battle.

In the end, Cybers were able to push the Brothers back to their ships and force them to retreat.

It is widely believed that the response to these relentless (yet unsuccessful) Deltan attacks may be swift and decisive, but the factions first have to deal with the threat of [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) in Minds' lands.
