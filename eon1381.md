## [Eon 1381](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1381>) - Hesitant Battle of Imperial Swamp

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) (combined faction forces)

Ahead of this [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) outburst, the plan was laid out, delivered to the troops, and everything was ready to be executed according to it.

And it did. Until it did not. And then we were back on track. But then plans fell through again.

The fight was chaotic, as _Corruption_ itself seemed to behave unpredictably, changing its manifestation with each passing hour.

Eventually, the factions caught on to the new patterns of _Corruption's_ behavior and adapted, pushing it back to the very fringes of the [Imperial Swamp](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/imperial_swamp.html>).

The name of this battle comes from the leadership's hesitance to either commit to their plans or call them off - a decision that seemed to change hour by hour.

With _Corruption_ at bay for now, these unexpected changes in its patterns ahead of the planned [Cycle of Restoration](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cycle_of_restoration.html>) leave everyone wary of the difficult task at hand.
