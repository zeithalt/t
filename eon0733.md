## Eon 733 - The Frantic Battle over A'as Forest

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Protectores Silva](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html)

This battle was long anticipated by both sides, but [Loki](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/loki.html) took his time to strike at an unexpected time and in an unexpected place... 

However, [Protectores Silva](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html) were ready for that: they had their defenses distributed equally over their lands, and [A'as Forest](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/aas_forest.html) had formidable defenses.

With [Cybers](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html), [Silvan](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html) and the [Fighters Guild](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html) on one side, and [Deltans](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html) with [Minds](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html) on the other, this battle was going to be a close one.

Despite quickly losing the initiative and all the chaos that ensued, [Protectores Silva](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html) managed to keep their heads cool and with a considerable effort and unforeseen amount of resources were able to fend off the attack.
