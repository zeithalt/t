## [Eon 619](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0619>) - The Reclamation of Imperial Swamp

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>)

[Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) attacks and claims [Imperial Swamp](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/imperial_swamp.html>) in a battle known as _Reclamation of the Imperial Swamp_.

After a devastating loss to [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) and the following [restoration projects](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_restoration_project.html>) the _Imperial Swamp_ stood as unoccupied and CR-free land - a chance seen and seized by the _Protectores Silva_.

Prompted by [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>), the rush to capture the _Imperial Swamp_ started, but having used the [Corrupted Shards](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_shards.html>), the _Silvans_ were ahead of others the entire battle and secured the victory.
