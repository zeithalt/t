`⚔️ Battle` won by [Protectores Silva](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html) (military exercise)

With the help of [Cybernetics Inc](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html) and [Delta Collective](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html), the [Silvans](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html) were able to defend their lands the MT attack.

However, [MindTech Institute](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html) sent out message to let other factions know that this was a joint military exercise with [Protectores Silva](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html) and their faction is committed to their claimed goal of pursuing peace on the Zeithalt.
