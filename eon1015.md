## [Eon 1015](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1015>) - Divine Battle of Ares Gardens

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

As expected, after the recent defeat in the [Battle of Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1007>), the  [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) has made a move to reclaim the region of [Ares Gardens](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/ares_gardens.html>) from [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>).

The battle was fierce and bloody, with the attackers taking an early lead, but then getting bogged down in the defence trenches put up by the Silvans.

In the end, the attackers were able to break through with a risky special operation and take control of the region.

This battle will also be remembered as the first ever case of the [King of Zeithalt](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/king_of_zeithalt.html>) using their divine power to directly intervene in the affairs of the Island.
