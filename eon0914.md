## [Eon 914](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0914>) - Resourceful Battle over Peace Death Gorge

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

In this battle, an unexpected attack by the Cybers catches Deltans off guard in the [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>).

Shortly after the battle breaks out, the cybers unveil their secret weapon: a massive special operation starts in which both sides spend truly enormous amounts of resources.

By some estimates, the resources spent in this single battle are about the same as the total resources collected over the whole island in the last 90 eons.

This can only be described by both sides of the conflict falling deep into the sunk cost fallacy. Several reports say that both CI and DC are now in a state of complete resource exhaustion. 

However, this battle is not without winners, as there are rumours of some other factions making a fortune in the process by selling resources to the warring sides.
