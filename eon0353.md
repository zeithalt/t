`⌛ Event`

Predictions about [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) targets are no longer based on rumours and prophecies.

Due to ongoing peace, factions have set up an extensive network of control stations and research facilities all over the island.

Based on the observations done by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) scientists, it is reported that the first signs of approaching [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) are appearing in [A’as Forest](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/aas_forest.html>).
