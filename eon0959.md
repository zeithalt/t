## [Eon 959](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0959>) - Band of Brothers is founded

`⌛ Event`

After extensive and secretive preparations, the founders of the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) finally come out in the open as the newest faction on the Island.

A group of renown Deltan warriors - *INK*, *T*, *Macmep*, *40* and *Кіт муркіт* set on a path to lead the faction.

After a short, but destructive war between [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) and [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) the region of [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>) lay in ruins and disorder.

A Deltan task force was sent out to clean up the unlawful mess here. It seems they might have done their job a little bit too well... for they were able to bring order to this region and build a new administration here.

A one that has grown so powerful that it fell out of the control of the Deltan central power.

Today [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) officially transfers Brickland Fortress under the governance of the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>).

Will the newest power on the Island bring peace to these war-torn lands? Or will it disappear just as quickly as it appeared on the Island?

Only the time will tell.
