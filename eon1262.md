## [Eon 1262](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1262>) - Invasion of Synaxos Fields

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>)

While the expected place of the next _Brothers'_ attack was [Paradox Pass](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/paradox_pass.html>), the allied Deltan and [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>)' forces instead launched a surprise attack on the [Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>).

This move essentially repeated the attack launched from Admincity a dozen eons ago, but this time even the attackers were surprised by the lack of preparation and the meek resistance from the defenders.

While the _Brothers'_ performed a vast landing along the whole coastline of _Synaxos Fields_, the Cybers were able to launch a land invasion from their enclave in neighbouring [Xyrclaox Watch](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/xyrclaox_watch.html>).

It's worth noting that for several battles in a row, [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>)'s Nex remains the main contributor to the defences of the allied Minds-Silvans forces. But there's a limit to how much he can do alone, and even the mighty Nex was unable to hold the line against the overwhelming forces of the _Brothers_.

The battle ended with yet another decisive victory for the _Brothers_, whose threat is now looming over the very MindTechs' capital city of [Neuropolis](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/neuropolis.html>).
