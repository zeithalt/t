## [Eon 1266](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1266>) - BB gives back control over Admincity to CI

`âŒ› Event`

As the events of the _War on MindTech_ continue to unfold, the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) have made another unexpected move by returning control over [Admincity](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/admincity.html>) back to the [Cybernetic Imperium](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1221>).

This clearly indicated that the _Brothers_ had some kind of deal with [NAIRO](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/nairo.html>) and the _Cybers_ for an attack opportunity against MindTech.

With this change on the map, the old _Minds_ mockery of the _Headless Empire_ is now gone, but it seems that the _Minds_ themselves are now worthy of a similar title.

With the continued loss of lands, it's rumoured that the faction experiences a vacuum of power, and the _Minds_ are now looking for a new leader to take charge of the faction.
