## Eon 452 - Technological advancement - Taxes and Land Income

`⌛ Event`

In the time between battles [Bank of Zeithalt](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/bank_of_zeithalt.html) introduces taxes - land income and battle tax:
- battle tax is imposed upon faction members as a way to fill up faction treasuries;
- land income is collected by factions from the lands under their control.

Factions immediately started investing into their own economy by building land improvements that earn more income:
- [Cybernetics Inc](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html) builds `💡SmartHome Tech` in [Neuropolis](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/neuropolis.html);
- [Protectores Silva](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html) builds `🌿 Photosynthetic Power Station` in [A’as Forest](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/aas_forest.html).
