## [Eon 452](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0452>) - Technological advancement - Taxes and Land Income

`âŒ› Event`

In the time between battles [Bank of Zeithalt](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/bank_of_zeithalt.html>) introduces taxes - land income and battle tax:
- battle tax is imposed upon faction members as a way to fill up faction treasuries;
- land income is collected by factions from the lands under their control.

Factions immediately started investing into their own economy by building land improvements that earn more income:
- [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) builds `ðŸ’¡SmartHome Tech` in [Neuropolis](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/neuropolis.html>);
- [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) builds `ðŸŒ¿ Photosynthetic Power Station` in [Aâ€™as Forest](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/aas_forest.html>).
