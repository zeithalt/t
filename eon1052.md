## [Eon 1052](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1052>) - Silvan Siege of Purple Deeps

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

After a confident [recent victory](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1044>) at Chaotic Plains, the joint forces of [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) were eager to continue their campaign. 

The next target was the Deltan capital - [Purple Deeps](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/purple_deeps.html>), an ambitious goal that nonetheless seemed achievable after the recent success.

However, the Deltans were prepared. They had fortified their defenses and were ready to repel the invaders. The Silvans and Cybers launched a massive assault, but the Deltans managed to hold their ground and at no point lost control over the battle.

In the end, attackers weren't even close to securing a victory in Purple Deeps, which hinted at a potential power shift in this war.

With the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) preparing their own retaliatory attack, everyone is eager to see how the situation will develop.
