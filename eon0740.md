## Eon 740 - The Battle Of Corrupted Mountain

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html) (combined faction forces)

As it happened many times previously, the existential threat of [Corruption](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html) is able to unite factions - even if temporarily - to fend off the greater danger.

We see it happen again this time - despite an ongoing war between the [Minds](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html) and [Deltans](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans) on one side and [Silvans](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html) with [Cybers](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html) on the other.

It was a long an enduring battle through the night, however the factions were able to hold their ground and push back the [Corruption](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html).

Notably, [Delta Collective](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html) had the strongest army on the battlefield, being almost equal to the combined forces of three other factions.
