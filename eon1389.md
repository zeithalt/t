## [Eon 1389](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1389>) - Grave Mistake in Webified Hills

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>)

Despite the [recently detected changes](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1381>) in _Corruption_ outbursts, the pre-planned operation to clear [Webified Hills](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/webified_hills.html>) was given the go-ahead.

The combined scientific forces of the _Deltans_, _Minds_, and _Cybers_ believed they had a good understanding of the newly discovered principles behind [CR Outbursts](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_fallout.html>) and had prepared a battle plan for the cleanup.

However, despite having all the data, the early hours of the operation showed that it would be much more difficult to accomplish than expected.

During the first phase of the battle, the factions barely managed to hold the line against the _Corruption_, forcing them to switch from their optimistic cleanup goal to a mere containment strategy.

However, even this revised plan turned out to be beyond the combined forces' ability.

In the final third of the battle, the _Corruption_ broke through their defenses and spread rapidly, consuming more than 60% of the _Webified Hills_ at its peak before the outburst subsided.

The result of the _Grave Mistake in Webified Hills_ is one more Corrupted land on Zeithalt Island - an unprecedented and grim reality as the situation on the Island seems to be spiraling out of control.
