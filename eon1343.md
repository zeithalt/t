## [Eon 1343](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1343>) - Sneezing Battle of Synaxos Fields

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

The [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) began its carefully planned recapture of [Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>) at night; however, it quickly became apparent that the [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) did not plan to defend this land, [much like in a previous encounter](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1327>).

Quickly losing ground, their forces mounted a minimal defense, only to ensure safe passage for their retreating troops.

However, the battle's unexpected complication was a [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) outburst spilling over from the nearby lands of [Xyrclaox Watch](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/xyrclaox_watch.html>).

Although the _Minds_ seemed prepared for this, the _Corruption_ broke through their defense line and began to spread rapidly across the _Synaxos Fields_.

While there were reports of the [Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) aiding the _Corruption_ early on - with some speculating they were responsible for the breach - Deltans from both factions were also seen helping the Minds fight against it.

One of the most notable events of the battle was an outbreak of a mutated [Mimps Virus](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mimps.html>) variant that caused excessive sneezing across the battlefield.

Warriors compromised their positions, missed their targets, and overall fought inefficiently due to frequent and violent sneezing fits.
