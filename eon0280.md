## [Eon 280](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0280>) - Battle of Brickland Fortress

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

Having won all previous battles, [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) is now believed the most powerful faction on the Island. They attack [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)'s [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>) hoping to catch DC in their weakest moment.

However, the influx of new warriors in Delta Collective and their ability to negotiate an alliance with [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) despite recent Deltan attack helps to change the tides and win the battle.
