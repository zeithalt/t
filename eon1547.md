## [Eon 1547](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1547>) - The Bombing of Oblivion Mire

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>)

From their recently acquired foothold in [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>), the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) launched a relentless attack on [Oblivion Mire](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/oblivion_mire.html>).

Slow at first, their crawling advance accelerated in the final third of the battle when the heavy bombing began.

Once the allied defences were broken, the [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) surrounded and quickly took the eastern part of _Oblivion Mire_, then focused their forces on eliminating the remaining pockets of resistance in the west.

Despite winning the battle in spectacular fashion, the _Band of Brothers_ also suffered a devastating loss.

A _Silvan_ artillery shell hit the _Brothers'_ command center. Early reports suggested the deaths of several high-ranking _Deltan_ officers, including almost the entire command staff of the _Band of Brothers_ faction.

It was later clarified that most survived the strike with minor injuries; however, the [founder and spiritual leader of the faction](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/t.html>) was confirmed dead.
