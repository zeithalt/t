## [Eon 962](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0962>) - Hijacking of the Brickland Fortress

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

[Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) joins [Silvan's](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) attack on [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>) and launches 
an unexpectedly strong blitz attack. 

The siege unfolds lightning-fast - with the use of heavy artillery and a successful special operation Cybers forces take the capital city of [Meadowridge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/meadowridge.html>) under their control. 

Soon after the capture, the attacking side makes the decision to raze the city.

Heavy fires and plundering begin on the streets of Meadowridge as the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) forces retreat from the area.


Civilians and bandits alike flee the city in terror as the Cybers go house by house and put all suspected Brothers' supporters to the sword, the torch and occasional blaster shot.

Not too long after, the city lays in ruins.

Ashes cover the empty shells of burnt out buildings like snow.

Once bustling streets and markets stay empty... as if the city has become a mere ghost of its former self.

Meadowridge will likely never have any supporters of the Brothers' again, but at what cost?
