## [Eon 1327](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1327>) - Effortless Recapture of Neuropolis

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

Although the _MindTech Institute_ was well-prepared for this battle, it soon became clear that the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) had no intention of fighting for [Neuropolis](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/neuropolis.html>).

At the first sign of an attack, the _Brothers'_ forces quickly retreated, leaving the city to the defenders.

Occasional skirmishes were reported, but these were mostly cover for the _Brothers_ to ensure a safe retreat for their forces.

In a notable event, the [Fighters Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>) used their outpost, acquired during the [siege of Neuropolis](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1313>), to get a head start on the defenders. They even held almost a third of the city for a time, but eventually ceded it to the _Minds_ as well.

In the end, despite having fallen just a dozen eons prior, the city was recaptured by the _Minds_ with little effort and next to no casualties.
