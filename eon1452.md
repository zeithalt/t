## [Eon 1452](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1452>) - Misguided Battle of Brickland Fortress

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

In the lead-up to the battle, [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) started an extensive diplomatic effort to temporarily pause fighting and prevent the spread of [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>).

After numerous attempts, the discussion, which included _Minds_, _Deltans_, _Silvans_, and _Brothers_ officials, yielded no results.

This resulted in a daring MindTech attack on the Deltan-controlled [Brickland Fortress](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brickland_fortress.html>), with the stated goal of forcing the _Deltans_ to clear _Corruption_ hotspots before resuming their war with the _Silvans_.

The major risk of this plan was the possibility of either the _Deltans_ or _Silvans_ using this attack as an opportunity to take more land in _Brickland_. And this is indeed what followed.

The _Silvans_ struck first, launching swift attacks into _Deltan_ territories. The _Deltans_, however, responded with even larger-scale counter-attacks and pushed the Silvan force entirely out of _Brickland_.

Along with this pushback, Deltan forces also successfully cleared the remnants of _Corruption_ in the region.
