## [Eon 802](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0802>) - Military Exercise in the Dev Null Marsh

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

Factions are conducting a military exercise in the [Dev Null Marsh](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/dev_null_marsh.html>) in the wake of the upcoming [CR Restoration Project](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_restoration_project.html>) in nearby [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>) and to prepare for future Corruption outbreaks. 

The [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) wins the exercise, showing the best coordination and tactics.

Shortly after the exercise, the factions complete back-to-back all three necessary _CR Restoration Project_ stages and the land is announced to be free from [corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>).

With that, the full restoration is far from over as such notable places as [Volcanic Jacuzzi](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/volcanic_jacuzzi.html>) and [Jurassic Part](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/jurassic_park.html>) were heavily damaged and still in need of attention.
