## Eon 715 - The Unfriendly Battle of Blue Screen Lagoon

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Protectores Silva](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html)

_Protectores Silva_ attacks [MindTech Institute](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html) and captures [Blue Screen Lagoon](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/blue_screen_lagoon.html).

This battle seemingly caught _MindTech Institute_ off guard as their performance in the battle was “poor” at best.

Initially meeting a strong defensive action form [Delta Collective](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html), _Protectores Silva_ backed up by _Cybers_ and the [Fighters Guild](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html) persisted as the battle lasted into the night where its fate was decided.

Due to previously friendly relations between _Minds_ and _Silvans_, this battle was named _The Unfriendly Battle of Blue Screen Lagoon_.
