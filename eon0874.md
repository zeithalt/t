## [Eon 874](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0874>) - The Daring Battle of Chaotic Plains

`⚔️ Battle` won by Delta Collective

[Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) repeats their [previous attempt](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0856>) at the [Chaotic Plains](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/chaotic_plains.html>) but this time with a bigger force and more an element of surprise.

In this battle, the Deltan and Minds alliance stand strong together, however, contrary to the last battle good preparation and timing pays off for the Silvans.

They algo get significant support from the [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) resulting in a much more balanced battle.

In the end, the Deltans and Minds are able to hold their ground and push back the attackers, but many attribute their success to the bad diplomatic preparation by the Silvan leadership. 

Their faction did not secure support of neither the [Fighters Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>) nor the [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>) for this battle.
