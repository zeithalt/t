## [Eon 1131](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1131>) - A Close Call in Xyrclaox Watch

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) (combined faction forces)

The longer the [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) is suppressed, the stronger it becomes.

This is the simple truth that the Island has learned many times over.

In anticipation of another outburst, this time in the [Xyrclaox Watch](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/xyrclaox_watch.html>), the factions were divided by war and in a deep crisis.

The location for this battle actually gave a glimmer of hope - the Watch being controlled by the MindTech Institute, the faction that has been somewhat neutral in the latest conflicts and could count on the support of both sides.

The battle was fierce, and the Corruption was relentless, but the combined forces of the factions managed to hold the line and stop the spread of Corruption just in time for this outburst to subside.

The Island can breathe a sigh of relief for now, but the Corruption always comes back.
