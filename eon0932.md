`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) (combined faction forces)

[Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>) faced an unprecedented 4th outbreak of [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>).

Despite floating rumours of factions plotting another huge conflict on the island, they were yet another time successful in uniting in the face of ever-growing threat.

The combined forces have managed to contain the outbreak and prevent it from spreading further, narrowly avoiding a disaster that could have had catastrophic consequences for the whole island.
