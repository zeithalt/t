## [Eon 1313](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1313>) - The 3rd Siege of Neuropolis

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>)

After successfully sabotaging the _Brothers'_ attempts to maneuver in the surrounding lands, the citizens of [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) still felt unsafe but remained hopeful nonetheless.

All their hopes came crashing down when, early in the siege, a defensive special operation by the _Minds_ was intercepted by the _Deltans_ and turned to their advantage. Temporary chaos ensued among the MindTech defenders, causing them to quickly lose ground to the attackers.

Despite suffering heavy losses, the defenders cleverly outmaneuvered the _Deltans_, grinding them down and disrupting their supply lines.

MindTech planned an immense comeback, launching another, even larger special operation. Once again, until the last moment, it was unclear whether the defenders would pull it off. 

However, they failed. The _Deltans_, with significant help from the [Cybernetic Imperium](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1221>) loyalists, once again hijacked the special operation and turned it to their favour.

This was a heavy blow to the _Minds_. Reportedly, the Council of Minds sat in stunned silence for several hours before ordering the evacuation of the city.

Shortly after, the _Brothers_, led by their leader [T](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/t.html>), breached the inner walls of the city, torching and plundering everything in sight. There were reports of attacks on fleeing civilians, looting, and the destruction of iconic Neuropolis landmarks.

As the city burned and MindTech people suffered, the _Deltans_ were seen celebrating their victory, dividing the riches of the ancient city among themselves and their _Cybernetics_ supporters.
