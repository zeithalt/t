## [Eon 1272](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1272>) - Fruitless Attempt at Chaotic Plains

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

On the southern front, the [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) launched a daring attack on the [Chaotic Plains](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/chaotic_plains.html>).

It was a fairly expected move, with most estimating that Silvan forces were not numerous enough to take on the Deltan capital, leaving the Chaotic Plains as the only viable target.

As a result, the defenders were fully prepared to meet the invaders. While the Silvan attack was bold and powerful as ever, it wasn't enough to overcome the Deltan defenses.

On a side note, both [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) and [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) were not meaningfully represented on the battlefield, likely gathering their forces elsewhere for their own impending clash.

This disappointing outcome of the battle left many on the Island wondering if the Silvans were overreaching by doing this assault relying mostly on their own strength.
