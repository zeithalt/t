## [Eon 778](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0778>) - The 3rd Outbreak in Synaxos Fields

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) (combined faction forces)

After the previous war and the tension it caused between the factions, the defense of [Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>) promised to be hard. 

There even were rumors of intentional sabotage against MindTech Institute efforts.

The fact that the faction had been suppressing [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) for several battles in a row did not help either.

However, the factions were able to gather a strong united force to aid MindTech Institute in the defense and avoid the global disaster.
