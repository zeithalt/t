## [Eon 1063](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1063>) - Retaliation on Peace Death Gorge

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

The long-awaited retaliation from the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) came in the form of a massive assault on the [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>). The Deltans were determined to make a statement after a chain of attacks on their lands.

They were able to take an early lead in the battle, securing almost the whole region by its midpoint. The Cybers, however, managed to regroup and launch a counter-offensive that turned the tide of the battle.

This counter-attack was a well-coordinated effort that heavily relied on [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) support. 

The counter-offensive slowly but surely picked up speed and pushed Deltans almost entirely out of the region. The Deltans tried to regroup and launch a counter-counter-offensive, but it was too late and not enough to influence the course of the battle.

The Cybers managed to push the Deltans back and secure a victory in the Peace Death Gorge, defending the land once taken from the Deltans.

Now, after both sides had unsuccessful attempts to capture each other's lands, the situation on the island remains tense and uncertain.

However, the faction will soon have to put aside their differences and unite against a common enemy - the signs of imminent [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) outburst started appearing in [Singularity Valley](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/singularity_valley.html>).
