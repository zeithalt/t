## [Eon 1268](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1268>) - BB gives control over Blue Screen Lagoon to CI

`âŒ› Event`

The [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) transfer another captured territory to the [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>).

This move further complicates the understanding of the BB/CI dynamic for the rest of the factions, as it previously seemed that _Brothers_ strong-armed _Cybers_ into a deal by holding their capital.

Now, however, after two land trades in a row, it seems as if _Bothers_ were capturing lands specifically for the _Cybers_.

Speaking of which, the political landscape over in the remaining MindTech lands is changing too. In a new surprising development, the _Minds_ invite [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>) founder [You](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/you.html>) to lead their faction.

It remains to be seen what are the true causes and intentions of all these changes on the Island, but what seems to be certain is that the War on MindTech is far from over.
