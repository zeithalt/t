## [Eon 749](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0749>) - The Burning of Cerene Vale

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

A devastating loss for [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) results in them having to flee their own capital, as it goes up in flames from the approaching [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>) army attacks.

The MT dictator [Loki](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/loki.html>) stops at nothing to get his revenge on the [Protectors](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) for what he calls a betrayal.

It's a second ever successful siege of a capital, and the first one where the attacking army decides to burn the city to the ground. 

Historians will remember this event as the _Burning of Cerene Vale_, and estimate that it might bear the same significance for the whole island as [Siege of Neuropolis (eon 384)](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0384>) and the [Disaster of Synaxos Fields (eon 508)](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0508>).

When the ash settles and the smoke clears, will the [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>) army march on to their next target? 

Or will the [Silvans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) be able to regroup and fight back?

Whichever way it goes, at the moment it seems the only way forward is through even more bloodshed and destruction.
