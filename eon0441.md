## [Eon 441](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0441>) - The Lakeside Battle of Webified Hills

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

In a stunning and unexpected attack near the [Lake Corsair](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/lake_corsair.html>), [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) reclaim their lands in _The Lakeside Battle of [Webified Hills](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/webified_hills.html>)_.

[Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) valiantly attempts to defend the territory but are ultimately unsuccessful due to bad preparation - they clearly were expecting an attack somewhere else, having almost no defense setup in the [Hills](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/webified_hills.html>).

Notable that [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) strongly supported the Cybers’ attack, however some of their members and paid sell-swords did hits helping [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) defenses too.

[Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) stayed true to their resolve of being a neutral force, hitting equally for both sides to earn some gold.
