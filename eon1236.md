## [Eon 1236](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1236>) - Fake Liberation of Admincity

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>)

In this battle, [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)
attempts to call for an uprising in [Admincity](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/admincity.html>) against recently declared [Cybernetic Imperium](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1221>).

The former CI capital was still under control of [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>), for which the Imperium was mockingly dubbed as "Headless Empire".

However, during the battle it became fully clear that this configuration of power was intentionally installed by CI/BB alliance, and the battle turned out a mere show of force to demonstrate the power of the new government.

As a result of [NAIRO](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/nairo.html>)'s firm grip on the faction, citizens of [Admincity](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/admincity.html>) were not willing to join the uprising, and instead, many of them were actively fighting against the attackers.

Any attempts to instigate a rebellion were swiftly crushed by the [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) forces, and the battle ended with a decisive victory for the _Brothers_.
