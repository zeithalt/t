## [Eon 1200](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1200>) - Masterful Defence of Webified Hills

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) (combined faction forces)

As a treat of yet another [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) outburst loomed over the [Webified Hills](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/webified_hills.html>), the prospects were grim.

With the faction being able to suppress the Corruption for several battles in a row (resulting in it growing stronger and stronger), it seemed that everyone was mentally ready to accept the defeat.

However, as the battle started, the unlikely close collaboration between [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) and [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) emerged.

With the novel strategic idea provided by the Band of Brothers, Cybers managed to refine their plans and turn the tide of the battle.

The situation remained tense until the end of the second eon of the battle as few people could fully believe that the new strategy would actually work as it was shown on paper.

But it did, and spectacularly so - the factions were able to fully clear the Corruption from the Webified Hills, giving new hope for the future Outbursts.
