## [Eon 347](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0347>) - CI calls for peace

`âŒ› Event`

Still working on repairs and seeing so much destruction around them from the recent corruption strike, [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) made a call for the idea of peace within the Island. 

CI have taken that first step themselves and chose not to engage in a new battle.
