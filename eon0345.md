## Eon 345 - The Battle of Corrupted Jungle

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html) (combined faction forces)

In this very close battle after several hours of fighting everyone was on edge till the very last minute. Though great cooperation the factions have once again defeated the [Corruption](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html) threat.

It is believed, however, that some [Delta Collective](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html) have intentionally not participated in the hope that [Cybertron Jungle](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybertron_jungle.html) would fall. It’s just a suspicion, but this idea can be poisonous for future politics on the island.

During the battle [MindTech Institute](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html) members were able to gather enough corrupted matter to synthesize [Corrupted Mines](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_mines.html) - powerful defensive weapon, first of its kind on Zeithalt.
