## [Eon 1341](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1341>) - CI transfers control over Paradox Pass to MT

`âŒ› Event`

[Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) transfers its portion of the [Paradox Pass](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/paradox_pass.html>) region to the [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>).

This move solidifies the recent shift within Cybernetics Inc following the fall of the [Cybernetic Imperium](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1221>) and seems to indicate that the two factions are on a course towards reconciliation.

The majority of _Paradox Pass_ is now back under the control of the _MindTech Institute_.

While it's worth noting that a third of the land is still occupied by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>) forces, they are now almost fully encircled by the _MindTech_ army in this region.
