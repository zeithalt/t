## Eon 330 - The Confusing Battle of Indigo Shore

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html)

The most notable events are [Cybernetics Inc](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html) joining forces with MindTech Institute to attack [Delta Collective](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html) after a long period of 6 battle when DC and CI where united. 

Quite confusing for DC who were quick to call it a betrayal.

Also, in the epic meme moment [Loki](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/loki.html) got confused and defended in the middle of his faction’s attack. This brought massive embarrassment to him as he was also a King of the Server at the time and everyone paid attention to his actions.

All this confusion granted the battle its name - The Confusing Battle of [Indigo Shore](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/indigo_shore.html).
