## [Eon 1512](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1512>) - Tomfoolery in Synaxos Fields

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

This battle was yet another routine (though important) and methodical [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) clean-up operation.

The highlight of the event was an unexpected cascade of war declarations.

For an unknown reason, almost all factions declared war on each other simultaneously. This confused the hell out of uptight and usually more collected leaders of [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) and [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>).

Some reports attribute this to the work of a hidden malicious actor, while others blame unfounded mass hysteria within the factions' high commands.

The truth, as always, probably lies somewhere in between.
