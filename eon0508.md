## [Eon 508](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0508>) - The Disaster of Synaxos Fields

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>)

[Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>) is a dead wasteland as factions fail to contain [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) surge.

Several new [Bank of Zeithalt](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/bank_of_zeithalt.html>) policies are in order following an attempt to save the economy of the Island.

Many people suffered exposure to [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) - the fate of those with severe cases is unknown at the moment of writing.

Most of [Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>) is currently in uninhabitable state, many places just dangerous to be in due to [Corruption Fallout](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_fallout.html>).

For sure, factions will study the phenomenon in the coming eons to see if at least something is recoverable, but for now _Synaxos Fields_ is considered to be a dead land.
