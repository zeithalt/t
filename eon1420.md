## [Eon 1420](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1420>) - Battle in Oblivion Mire

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) (combined faction forces)

Contrary to the [previous battle](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1412>), the cleanup of [Oblivion Mire](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/oblivion_mire.html>) was met with some controversy.

Following a dispute between the leadership of the [Fighters Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>) and [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>), the _Fighters_ decided to sabotage the cleanup efforts.

The faction's decision was intended as "punishment" for the _Silvans_ for their previous sabotage of the [Obsidian Wolf](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/obsidian_wolf.html>) launch a couple dozens of eons prior.

While many on the island were shocked by this decision and saw it as "helping Corruption capture Oblivion Mire," in practice, the _Fighters'_ effort was not nearly as impactful.

Both sides seemingly presented it as their victory. The _Fighters Guild_ claims to have caused the _Silvans_ a similar amount of damage in retaliation, while _Protectores Silva_ reports a successful cleanup effort with no major losses from the _Fighters'_ sabotage.
