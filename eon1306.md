## [Eon 1306](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1306>) - Stoic Defense of A'as Forest

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>)

[Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) attacked [A'as Forest](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/aas_forest.html>), having no other options to continue the ongoing assault on _MindTech Institute_ lands.

The attack was greatly anticipated by the defenders, who prepared a strong defense with the help of [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) and [Fighters Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>).

From the early hours of the battle, it was clear that the defenders were in a strong position, and the attackers did a bad job at preparing for the battle, which resulted in a crushing defeat for [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>).

Desperate troops of _Cybernetics Inc_ were seen fleeing the battlefield on several occasions, while the bulk of the two [Deltan factions](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) stayed away from engaging in the battle, which was a clear sign of their unwillingness to support _Cybers_ in this fight.

The biggest challenge for the defenders was an unexpected spill-over of [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) from the nearby [Oblivion Mire](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/oblivion_mire.html>), which was a constant threat to the defenders' positions. However, the _Minds_ employed a significant forced from the _Fighters Guild_ to hold the line and prevent the _Corruption_ from overwhelming their positions.

Controversially, some of the [Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/brothers.html>) were seen sabotaging anti-CR measures and actively helping it spread further into _MindTech_ lands - never before seen, but hugely controversial tactic.
