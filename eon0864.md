## [Eon 864](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0864>) - The Victory of Peace Death Gorge

`⚔️ Battle` won by Delta Collective (combined faction forces)

The [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) returns to [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>).

The combined faction forces are quickly railed up together to temporarily abandon their differences and focus on the common threat. 

As lately became the norm, the Corruption battle is long and brutal, but factions manage to push it back to its source. 

The [Peace Death Gorge](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html>) stands free from Corruption.
