## [Eon 969](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0969>) - Loss of the Illusion Cliffs

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>)

Yet another [Corruption Outburst](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_fallout.html>) happens in [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) lands.

Unfortunately, this time the combined faction forces were not able to contain it and [Illusion Cliffs](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/illusion_cliffs.html>) region is lost to it.

As the result of the ensuing _Corruption Fallout_ the region stands uninhabitable, many iconic sites like [Archives of Subconsciousness](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/archives_of_subcon.html>) and [Cave of Mirrors](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cave_of_mirrors.html>) now lay in ruins, and the population has to flee their homes.

Many notable warriors of all factions suffered severe Corruption poisoning and are now in critical condition.
