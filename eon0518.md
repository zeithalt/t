## [Eon 518](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0518>) - Restoration of Synaxos Fields

`⌛ Event`

After spending enormous amounts of resources and doing extensive research factions collectively complete @[CR Restoration Project](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_restoration_project.html>) in [Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>).

While these lands will forever remain scarred by the disaster and every man-made structure was destroyed while the event unfolded, Synaxos now stands clear from [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>).

Since all population was evacuated previously from [Synaxos Fields](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/synaxos_fields.html>), it is currently a free land, not belonging to any faction.

Many on the Island are wondering of this means a future peaceful collaboration to restore  to former glory…. or a threat of a new bloody conflict for controlling the land is looming over it.
