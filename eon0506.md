## Eon 506 - Rebellion in the Desert

`⚔️ Battle` won by [MindTech Institute](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html)

[MindTech Institute](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html) restore the order in the [Timeless Desert](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/timeless_desert.html)

The [Rebels](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/rebels.html) are driven away and into hideouts after the unsuccessful attempt to install themselves as a new governing power in the desert.

Unfortunately for [Rebels](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/rebels.html) they did not find the support of other factions to put up a good enough defence against [MindTech Institute](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html).

[Delta Collective](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html) and [Cybernetics Inc](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html) mostly stayed neutral, while [Protectores Silva](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html) joined the efforts to quell the rebellion.
