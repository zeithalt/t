## [Eon 1504](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1504>) - Ordinary Battle in Imperial Swamp

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Band of Brothers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/band_of_brothers.html>)

This battle in [Imperial Swamp](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/imperial_swamp.html>) was yet another calm and methodical [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) clean-up.

The most notable aspect was the immense effort the [Deltans](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) had to exert to fight the _Corruption_ in the absence of other factions on the battlefield.

The only faction that meaningfully helped them was [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>), prompting quiet discussions about their allegiance in future battles.

However, with a sizable chunk of CI's [Webified Hills](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/webified_hills.html>) still not cleared of [Corruption Fallout](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_fallout.html>), this might have just been their way of complying with treaties to ensure _Deltan_ support in the upcoming clean-up.
