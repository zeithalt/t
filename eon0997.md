## [Eon 997](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0997>) - Failed Siege of Purple Deeps

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

For the second time in the history of this great city, the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) have successfully defended the [Purple Deeps](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/purple_deeps.html>) from a siege by the [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>).

And if the [first attempt, made 386 eons ago](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0611>) was a weak effort and was easily fended off by Deltans, this time the Cybernetics Inc have shown a remarkable improvement in their tactics and coordination.

The battle was well prepared by Cybers securing both [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>) and [Fighters Guild](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/fighters_guild.html>) contracts at unprecedented rates; preparing the siege tactically and logistically; and even using the [CR Shards](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_shards.html>) to their advantage.

But the Deltans were ready, the city was well fortified and the defenders were well prepared.

The siege promised to be long and bloody, however, soon after its start both sides engaged in heavy artillery fire and the Cybers were eventually forced to retreat.

Rumors say that by placing so high stakes on this battle, the Cybers have lost a significant portion of their resources and money and are now in a vulnerable position.

However, it remains unclear if the Deltans will use this opportunity to strike back or they themselves are recovering after a costly victory.
