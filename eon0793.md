## Eon 793 - The Mourning of Peace Death Gorge

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Corruption](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html)

Despite all the preparation and the effort, a long period of factions being able to contain the thread of _Corruption_ has ended.

[Peace Death Gorge](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/peace_death_gorge.html) is uninhabitable, and the [Deltans](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html) are forced to evacuate the population.

Many people suffered exposure to _Corruption_ and are being hastily transported to the [CURE](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cure.html) facilities for treatment.

Due to continuous suppression of _Corruption_, this [fallout](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_fallout.html) seems to be much more violent and factions are not able to initiate the Containment phase of [CR Restoration Project](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cr_restoration_project.html) for a long time. 

As, sadly, became a routine procedure - [Bank of Zeithalt](https://zeithalt.github.io/r/bank_of_zeithalt.html) reinstates its restrictive policies on the Island's economy.
