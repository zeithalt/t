## [Eon 893](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0893>) - The Blunder on PEBKAC Peak

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>)

Reports before the battle said that previous [Deltan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/deltans.html>) loss [in Admincity](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0884>) was more or less planned event and that the bulk of their armies had already been focusing on a new target.

Among the cited possible targets, the [Silvan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) lands were mentioned the most. 

The Silvans, however, were not idle too and prepared for the incoming attack by joining forces with [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) to set up the ambush in [Cybertron Jungle](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybertron_jungle.html>) - the least defended land of the Silvans.

This move seemingly confused Deltan leadership, who were getting conflicting reports about the situation in Cybertron Jungle and mistook it as preparation for future CI action against them.

As a result, the Deltans attempted to outmaneuver Cyber forces by attacking the PEBKAC Peak instead and were greeted by a much larger force than they expected, which included their former allies - the [Minds](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/minds.html>).

It is generally agreed that the Deltans would have had a much easier time fighting [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) in the east instead, and many see this attack as a strategic blunder made by Deltan generals.
