## [Eon 1485](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1485>) - Almost Festive Battle in Chaotic Plains

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) (combined faction forces)

Since the time the [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) outburst was predicted to occur in the [Chaotic Plains](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/chaotic_plains.html>), most on the Island expected yet another calm and calculated clean-up battle.

This proved true - with regard to the _Corruption_ - however, during the battle, tensions were much higher than anticipated.

In the lead-up to the event, both the [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) and [Protectores Silva](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/protectores_silva.html>) had prepared for battle.

While the actual anti-CR effort was performed by the _Deltans_ (and other combined faction forces), the _Silvans_ seemingly used the time to strengthen their holdings in the Chaotic Plains.

Throughout the entire operation, _Deltan_ and _Silvan_ forces stood in confrontation against each other, prepared for a clash... which never came.

The battle ended with the complete eradication of _Corruption_ in the region, with both sides having cleaned it up from the lands they controlled.
