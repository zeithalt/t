## [Eon 836](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0836>) - Successful landing at the Virtuara Outpost

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>)

After a previous attempt more than [300 eons ago](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon0501>), many though that the sea attack on the [Virtuara Outpost](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/virtuara_outpost.html>) could not succeed.

However, [Delta Collective](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/delta_collective.html>) managed to surprise the defenders and land a significant force on the shores of the Outpost.

Once again, the Deltan forces supported by a smaller [MindTech Institute](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/mindtech_institute.html>) force completely dominated the battlefield.

Even though [Cybers](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybers.html>) were prepared for the attack, got the help from their [Silvan](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/silvans.html>) allies and hired the support of the [Cloudy Operatives](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cloudy_operatives.html>), the sheer number of Deltan troops was simply overwhelming.

While the further plans of the Deltan commanders are unknown, the _Virtuara_ provides them an excellent strategic position to launch further attacks on the _Cybers'_ territory. It opens up such possibilities as a direct attack on [Admincity](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/admincity.html>) or a push deeper into CI territory, cutting off their capital from the supply lines.
