## [Eon 1427](<https://zeithalt.github.io/t/#eon1427>) - Calm Defence of Blue Screen Lagoon

`⚔️ Battle` won by [Cybernetics Inc](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/cybernetics_inc.html>) (combined faction forces)

This [Corruption](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/corruption.html>) Outburst in [Blue Screen Lagoon](<https://zeithalt.github.io/r/blue_screen_lagoon.html>) was fended off with the same calm and collected response from the organized factions' forces as seen in previous anti-CR cleanups.

The factions had a plan, and they followed it.

_Corruption_ never posed any danger to the majority of the _Lagoon_. It was promptly contained in the western regions and methodically cleared until the Outburst subsided.

Will this unprecedented efficiency continue? Or will the factions get too comfortable living alongside the dangerous _Corruption_ and eventually miss a critical blow?

Only time will tell.
